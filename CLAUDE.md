# PlugHub Platform — Global Architectural Context

## What PlugHub is

PlugHub is an enterprise orchestration platform that connects agents —
human and AI, from any origin — to business systems and customers,
with measurable quality and without creating lock-in. It is the infrastructure
that makes service delivery possible, not the delivery itself.

Full architectural specification: `plughub_spec_v1.docx` (root of this repo).

## Unified Session Model

Every contact is a conference room. There is no distinction between a normal flow
and a conference flow — the logic is singular. The Core creates the session on every
new contact; agents simply join the room with their queues and receive messages
according to their configured visibility options.

### Participant roles

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| `primary` | Main agent responsible for the interaction |
| `specialist` | Invited expert (task step, assist mode) |
| `supervisor` | Human or AI supervisor monitoring the session |
| `evaluator` | Quality agent evaluating the session (online or post-session) |
| `reviewer` | Human agent reviewing the evaluator's output |

### Session status

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| `active` | Session in progress with at least one participant |
| `closed` | Session ended normally |
| `abandoned` | No agent joined before the session ended |

### close_reason domain

```
no_resource          — no agents available and no queue configured
max_wait_exceeded    — max queue wait time exceeded
customer_disconnect  — client disconnected (connection_lost)
customer_hangup      — client ended actively (voice/video)
customer_abandon     — client left before being served
flow_complete        — Skill Flow complete step
agent_transfer       — transferred to another pool
agent_hangup         — agent ended actively
session_timeout      — session inactive beyond TTL
system_error         — unrecoverable error
```

### Message visibility

Three distinct modalities — not complementary:

| Visibility | Recipients | Typical use |
|---|---|---|
| `all` | All participants including the customer | Normal service message |
| `agents_only` | All agents, without the customer | Internal note between agents |
| `["part_abc", "part_xyz"]` | Only the listed participant_ids | Supervisor → specific agent, private, without other agents seeing |

## Invariants — never violate

- **AI Gateway is stateless** — processes one turn per LLM call. No state between turns.
- **Routing Engine is the sole arbiter** — no component routes a conversation without going through it.
- **MCP is the only integration protocol** — no direct REST between internal components.
- **pipeline_state persists to Redis on every step transition** — never in memory only.
- **Agent contract**: `agent_login` → `agent_ready` → `agent_busy` → `agent_done`
- **`agent_done` requires `handoff_reason`** when `outcome !== "resolved"`
- **`issue_status` is always required and never empty** in `agent_done`
- **Agents never access backend systems directly** — only via authorised MCP Servers
- **All domain MCP calls are intercepted** — native agents via `McpInterceptor` (in-process, `@plughub/sdk`); external agents via proxy sidecar (`plughub-sdk proxy` on localhost:7422). No MCP call reaches a domain server without permission validation, injection guard, and audit.
- **`insight.historico.*` persists via Kafka, never direct PostgreSQL write** — `insight_register` publishes `insight.registered` to `conversations.events`; a consumer promotes `insight.conversa.*` → `insight.historico.*` on `contact_closed`. Persistence boundary is the contact, not the agent session.

## MCP interception — hybrid proxy model

Domain MCP Servers (mcp-server-crm, mcp-server-telco, etc.) are separate from
mcp-server-plughub and are operated by the tenant. All calls to them must be
intercepted for permission validation and audit:

| Agent type | Interception mechanism | Network hop |
|---|---|---|
| Native agent (uses SDK) | `McpInterceptor` in-process (`@plughub/sdk`) | None |
| External agent (LangGraph, CrewAI) | `plughub-sdk proxy` sidecar on localhost:7422 | Loopback only |

Both paths perform the same checks per call (< 1ms total overhead):
1. **Permission validation** — `permissions[]` decoded from JWT locally (no network)
2. **Injection guard** — heuristic regex against 13 prompt injection patterns
3. **Audit record** — `AuditRecord` written async to Kafka topic `mcp.audit` (fire-and-forget)

### McpInterceptor (in-process — `@plughub/sdk`)

```typescript
const interceptor = new McpInterceptor({
  getSessionToken: () => lifecycle.currentToken,   // refreshed automatically
  delegate: (server, tool, args) => mcpClient.callTool(server, tool, args),
  kafka_brokers: ["kafka:9092"],
})
interceptor.start()

// In agent handler — replaces direct MCP client calls:
const result = await interceptor.callTool("mcp-server-crm", "customer_get", { customer_id })
```

Throws `McpInterceptorError` with `code: "PERMISSION_DENIED"` or `"INJECTION_DETECTED"`.
Call-level audit enrichment via `opts.audit_context`.

### Proxy sidecar (external agents — `plughub-sdk proxy`)

```bash
PLUGHUB_SESSION_TOKEN=<jwt> plughub-sdk proxy --config proxy_config.yaml
```

`proxy_config.yaml`:
```yaml
port: 7422
session_token_env: PLUGHUB_SESSION_TOKEN
kafka_brokers: ["kafka:9092"]          # omit for stdout fallback (dev)
audit_topic: mcp.audit
routes:
  mcp-server-crm:     ${MCP_CRM_URL}
  mcp-server-billing: ${MCP_BILLING_URL}
```

Path: `POST /mcp-server-crm/mcp` → forwards to `${MCP_CRM_URL}/mcp`.
Returns `403` on permission denied or `400` on injection detected (never forwards).

### AuditRecord (Kafka topic `mcp.audit`)

```typescript
AuditRecord {
  event_type: "mcp.tool_call"
  timestamp, tenant_id, session_id, instance_id
  server_name, tool_name
  allowed: boolean              // false = blocked before forwarding
  permissions_checked: string[] // permissions[] from JWT
  injection_detected: boolean
  injection_pattern?: string    // pattern_id if detected
  duration_ms: number           // 0 if blocked pre-forward
  data_categories?: DataCategory[]
  input_snapshot?: unknown      // only when audit_policy.capture_input = true
  output_snapshot?: unknown     // only when audit_policy.capture_output = true
  audit_context?: { reason?, correlation_id? }
  source: "in_process" | "proxy_sidecar"
}
```

The proxy sidecar validates `permissions[]` from the session_token JWT locally
(no network call, ~0.1ms) and writes audit events asynchronously to a local buffer
drained by a background thread to Kafka. Total overhead per MCP call: **< 1ms**.

### Audit policy — per tool, not per call

Each tool defines its own audit policy. The caller cannot opt out of audit records
(LGPD risk). The caller may only enrich with additional context:

```typescript
// On the tool definition (not per call)
audit_policy: {
  data_categories: DataCategory[]
  capture_input: boolean
  capture_output: boolean
  retention_days: number
  requires_consent: boolean
}

// Caller may add (never suppress)
audit_context?: { reason?: string, correlation_id?: string }
```

## Component responsibilities (summary)

| Component | Sole responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Core** | Session lifecycle, canonical stream, message masking, adapter coordination |
| **Channel Gateway** | Inbound normalisation, outbound rendering, fallback interaction collection, multi-site heartbeat |
| **AI Gateway** | Stateless LLM inference. Does not manage session or history. |
| **Agent Registry** | CRUD for AgentType, Pool, Skill, GatewayConfig. Cache invalidation via Kafka. |
| **Routing Engine** | Agent allocation, queue management, scoring algorithm, close_reason detection |
| **Rules Engine** | Post-routing event evaluation. Publishes consequences. No routing, no Redis polling. |
| **Skill Flow Engine** | Flow interpreter. Persists pipeline_state to Redis on every step. |

## Instance Bootstrap — reconciliation-driven agent instance management

Implemented in `packages/orchestrator-bridge/src/plughub_orchestrator_bridge/instance_bootstrap.py`.

**Principle**: Agent Registry is the single source of truth. The Bootstrap operates as a
**reconciliation controller** (Kubernetes-style): it compares *desired state* (Registry)
with *actual state* (Redis) and applies only the minimum diff to converge them.
No restart needed for any configuration change — the controller self-heals.

### Reconciliation algorithm

```
reconcile(tenant_id):
  # Section A — Agent instances
  agent_types    = GET /v1/agent-types
  registry_pools = GET /v1/pools          ← single call, all pools
  desired        = build_desired_state(agent_types, registry_pools)
  actual         = scan {tenant}:instance:* from Redis

  diff:
    to_create  → write instance key + SADD pool SET
    to_delete  → status=ready: DELETE + SREM  |  status=busy: mark draining=True
    to_update  → status=ready: update payload  |  status=busy: mark pending_update=True
    to_renew   → EXPIRE only (payload identical, TTL refresh)

  sync pool:*:instances SETs

  # Section B — Pools
  for each pool in registry_pools:
    if pool_config key missing or content diverged → SET pool_config:{pool_id}
    else → EXPIRE only (renew TTL)

  for each pool_config:* key in Redis NOT in registry_pools:
    DELETE pool_config:{pool_id}
    if pool:{pool_id}:instances SET is empty → DELETE it too

  sync {tenant}:pools global SET (+adds, -removes)
```

### Trigger points

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| Bridge startup | `reconcile()` — full diff + apply; logs ReconciliationReport |
| Heartbeat every 15s | `_heartbeat_tick()` — TTL renewal + drain/pending_update processing |
| Every 5 min (periodic) | `reconcile()` — auto-healing of any drift |
| `registry.changed` (Kafka) | `reconcile()` — immediate after signal |
| `config.changed` namespace=`quota` (Kafka) | `reconcile()` — quota limits changed, may affect instance count |

### Dry-run (audit without applying)

```python
report = await bootstrap.dry_run("tenant_demo")
print(report.summary())
# tenant=tenant_demo created=2 deleted=1 drained=0 updated=1 renewed=7 unchanged=0 errors=0 (45ms)
```

### ReconciliationReport fields

Instances: `created`, `deleted`, `drained`, `updated`, `renewed`, `unchanged`

Pools: `pools_written` (created or updated), `pools_removed` (deleted from Redis), `pools_set_sync` (IDs added/removed from `{tenant}:pools` SET)

Common: `errors`, `duration_ms`, `dry_run`

### Rules

- Human agents are NOT managed — login is user-initiated via Agent Assist UI.
- Busy/paused instances are never hard-deleted; they receive `draining=True` or `pending_update=True` and are processed by the heartbeat after the session ends.
- Idempotent: reconciling N times produces the same result as reconciling once.
- Instance IDs: `{agent_type_id}-{n+1:03d}` (e.g. `agente_demo_ia_v1-001`).
- `channel_types` on instances = union of `channel_types` from all associated pools.

### RegistrySyncer — YAML as single source of truth for PostgreSQL

Implemented in `packages/orchestrator-bridge/src/plughub_orchestrator_bridge/registry_syncer.py`.
Runs BEFORE InstanceBootstrap at bridge startup. Reads `infra/registry/*.yaml` and:

1. **Upserts** pools and agent_types via Agent Registry REST API (POST → 201 created, 409 → PATCH)
2. **Prunes** stale agent_types not declared in YAML (`REGISTRY_SYNC_PRUNE=true`, default)
   - Lists all agent_types via `GET /v1/agent-types` and DELETEs any not present in the YAML
   - DELETE publishes `registry.changed` to Kafka → InstanceBootstrap cleans up Redis automatically
   - Set `REGISTRY_SYNC_PRUNE=false` to disable (multi-tenant environments with external agent registrations)

A fresh environment is fully self-configuring from YAML alone. Stale entries from old seeds or manual API calls are removed automatically on every startup — making DROP TABLE unnecessary.

### Skill sync — YAML → Agent Registry (PostgreSQL)

In addition to pools and agent_types, RegistrySyncer also syncs **skill definitions** from
`packages/skill-flow-engine/skills/` to the Agent Registry at bridge startup.

**`skills_dir` parameter** — path to the skills directory passed to RegistrySyncer:
```python
syncer = RegistrySyncer(
    registry_url=AGENT_REGISTRY_URL,
    config_path=REGISTRY_CONFIG_DIR or None,
    skills_dir=SKILLS_DIR or None,        # e.g. /app/skills
)
```

**Requirements for a YAML to be synced:**
- Must have `id:` field matching regex `^skill_[a-z0-9_]+_v\d+$` (e.g. `skill_sac_ia_v1`)
- Must have `entry:` and `steps:` fields (minimal valid SkillFlow)
- `name:`, `version:`, `description:`, `classification:` are optional (sensible defaults applied)
- `mention_commands:` at the top-level YAML is included in the payload if present

Skills are PUT (upserted) before pools and agent_types to ensure agent_types can reference them.
Skill IDs that don't match the regex (e.g. missing `id:` field) are silently skipped.

**`SyncReport`** extended fields: `skills_upserted`, `skills_skipped`, `skills_errors`.

### Skill hot-reload — three-elo architecture

The skill hot-reload pipeline ensures that updating a YAML file propagates to running agents
without manual cache clearing. Three components work together:

```
Elo 1 — RegistrySyncer (startup sync)
  bridge restart → reads *.yaml from SKILLS_DIR
  → PUT /v1/skills/{skill_id} → PostgreSQL is source of truth

Elo 2 — registry.changed event (agent-registry/routes/skills.ts)
  PUT /v1/skills/{id} → publishRegistryChanged(entity_type="skill", entity_id=skill_id)
  DELETE /v1/skills/{id} → publishRegistryChanged(entity_type="skill", entity_id=skill_id)
  → Kafka topic: registry.changed

Elo 3 — cache invalidation (orchestrator-bridge/main.py)
  registry.changed received → entity_type == "skill"
  → del _skill_flow_cache[skill_id]
  → next agent activation fetches updated flow from Agent Registry
```

**Live production update (no restart required):**
```
PUT /v1/skills/skill_copilot_sac_v1  →  registry.changed  →  cache invalidated  →  immediate effect
```

**`_skill_flow_cache`** — in-memory dict in orchestrator-bridge `main.py` mapping
`skill_id → flow dict`. Populated on first agent activation (GET /v1/skills/{id}).
Invalidated individually per skill_id on `registry.changed` events.

**Note:** POST (create) on `/v1/skills` does NOT publish `registry.changed` — it is only
used by RegistrySyncer at startup, where a cache miss on first activation is acceptable.

**Known issue:** `agente_avaliacao_v1.yaml` has no `complete` or `escalate` step, which
causes Agent Registry to return HTTP 422. RegistrySyncer logs a warning and increments
`skills_errors` but does not block startup. The evaluator agent falls back to reading the
YAML file directly via `_load_yaml_fallback()`.

### Impact on seed

`infra/seed/seed.py` no longer writes Redis instance keys, pool instance sets, pool_config
keys, or the `{tenant}:pools` SET — all of those are handled exclusively by InstanceBootstrap.
The seed only registers pools and agent types in the Agent Registry API (PostgreSQL).

## Context-Aware Progressive Resolution

Padrão para coleta e acumulação inteligente de dados do cliente ao longo da sessão.
Evita re-coletar dados já presentes com confiança suficiente.

### ContactContext (`@plughub/schemas/contact-context.ts`)

Schema em `packages/schemas/src/contact-context.ts`. Armazenado em `pipeline_state.contact_context`.

Cada campo é um `ContactContextField`:
```typescript
{ value: string, confidence: number, source: ContactContextSource, resolved_at?: string }
```

**Fontes (ContactContextSource):**
| Source | Descrição |
|---|---|
| `pipeline_state` | Herdado de agente anterior na mesma sessão |
| `insight_historico` | Memória de longo prazo (contatos anteriores) |
| `insight_conversa` | Gerado na sessão atual por outro step |
| `mcp_call` | Consultado via MCP tool (CRM, billing, etc.) |
| `customer_input` | Fornecido diretamente pelo cliente nesta sessão |
| `ai_inferred` | Inferido pelo AI Gateway a partir da conversa |

**Modelo de confiança:**
| Range | Significado |
|---|---|
| 0.9–1.0 | Confirmado explicitamente — usar sem confirmação |
| 0.7–0.9 | Inferido com alta certeza — usar sem confirmação |
| 0.4–0.7 | Incerto — confirmar se `force_confirmation = true` |
| 0.0–0.4 | Desconhecido — coletar novamente |

**Campos:**
`customer_id`, `cpf`, `account_id`, `nome`, `telefone`, `email`, `motivo_contato`,
`intencao_primaria`, `sentimento_atual`, `resumo_conversa`, `resolucoes_tentadas[]`,
`dados_crm` (raw MCP payload), `campos_ausentes[]`, `campos_incertos[]`, `completeness_score`

### agente_contexto_ia_v1

Pool: `contexto_ia` (role: specialist — sem tráfego direto de clientes).
Skill: `packages/skill-flow-engine/skills/agente_contexto_ia_v1.yaml`.

**Invocação:** via `task` step com `mode: assist` + `execution_mode: sync` em qualquer agente especialista.

**Fluxo interno (v2 — usa ContextStore + @ctx.*):**
```
verificar_gaps (choice):  @ctx.caller.customer_id exists → buscar_crm
                          @ctx.caller.cpf exists         → buscar_crm
                          default                        → verificar_completude
verificar_completude (choice): @ctx.caller.motivo_contato confidence_gte 0.7 → finalizar
                               default → gerar_pergunta
buscar_crm (invoke: mcp-server-crm/customer_get)
  → context_tags.outputs: nome/cpf/account_id/… → caller.* (confidence=0.95, fire-and-forget)
gerar_pergunta (reason LLM #1): pergunta consolidada → session.pergunta_coleta
coletar_cliente (menu): prompt = {{@ctx.session.pergunta_coleta}}
extrair_campos (reason LLM #2): campos extraídos → caller.* via context_tags
finalizar (complete)
```

**Garantias:**
- 0 chamadas LLM quando CRM resolve o contexto; no máximo 2 quando necessário coletar
- Nunca pergunta ao cliente o que já está com `confidence ≥ 0.8`
- Gera uma única pergunta consolidada (não formulário campo por campo)
- Busca CRM automaticamente antes de perguntar ao cliente
- Nunca bloqueia o fluxo — `on_failure` sempre avança (`finalizar_parcial`)

### Propagação entre agentes

O ContextStore (`{tenantId}:ctx:{sessionId}`) persiste durante toda a sessão.
Todos os agentes da cadeia lêem e escrevem no mesmo hash Redis — sem cópia entre agentes:

```
agente_sac_ia_v1
  → analisar (reason): lê @ctx.caller.nome/@ctx.session.historico_mensagens
                        escreve session.ultima_resposta, session.escalar_solicitado via context_tags
  → verificar_escalada (choice): @ctx.session.escalar_solicitado eq true → acumular_contexto
  → acumular_contexto (task assist: agente_contexto_ia_v1)
       agente_contexto_ia_v1 enriquece caller.* no ContextStore
  → escalar → agente_retencao_humano_v1
       supervisor_state devolve context_snapshot ao Agent Assist UI
       ContextoTab (aba Contexto) exibe campos agrupados por namespace
```

### Adicionando context-awareness a um novo agente especialista

```yaml
# Após a saudação, antes de qualquer step que dependa de dados do cliente:
- id: acumular_contexto
  type: task
  target:
    skill_id: agente_contexto_ia_v1
  mode: assist
  execution_mode: sync
  on_success: proximo_step
  on_failure: proximo_step   # nunca bloquear
```

### Fase 2 — Co-pilot (próxima iteração)

Durante sessão do agente humano, AI Gateway analisa cada mensagem do cliente em background
usando `contact_context` e popula a aba "Capacidades" do Agent Assist UI com:
- Sugestão de resposta personalizada
- Flags de risco (sentimento, intenção detectada)
- Ações recomendadas com base no `motivo_contato`

### Fase 3 — Step `resolve` nativo (futuro)

Novo step type no `skill-flow-engine` que encapsula a lógica do `agente_contexto_ia_v1`
de forma declarativa, permitindo que qualquer agente defina seus pré-requisitos de contexto
inline no YAML sem depender de um agente externo.

## ContextStore — unified session state

O ContextStore substitui `pipeline_state.contact_context` como repositório de estado de sessão.
É um Redis hash por sessão no qual qualquer componente pode ler e escrever campos tipados.

### Redis key format

```
{tenantId}:ctx:{sessionId}   (hash Redis)
  field = tag name (e.g. "caller.nome", "session.sentimento.current")
  value = JSON-encoded ContextEntry
```

### ContextEntry schema (`@plughub/schemas/context-store.ts`)

```typescript
ContextEntry {
  value:      unknown           // string | number | boolean | object
  confidence: number            // 0.0–1.0
  source:     string            // "mcp_call:mcp-server-crm:customer_get" | "ai_inferred:sentiment_emitter" | …
  visibility: "agents_only" | "all"
  updated_at: string            // ISO-8601
}
```

### Tag namespaces

| Namespace | Escopo | Escrito por |
|---|---|---|
| `caller.*` | Dados do cliente (nome, cpf, conta, motivo) | ContextAccumulator via MCP tools; reason step context_tags |
| `session.*` | Estado da sessão atual | reason/invoke steps via context_tags; sentiment_emitter (session.sentimento.*) |
| `account.*` | Dados de conta (plano, status) | invoke step com buscar_crm via context_tags |

### context_tags on reason / invoke steps

Qualquer step `reason` ou `invoke` pode declarar mapeamentos de entrada/saída:

```yaml
context_tags:
  inputs:
    nome_cliente:
      tag: caller.nome
      required: false       # campo opcional
  outputs:
    resposta:
      tag: session.ultima_resposta
      confidence: 1.0
      merge: overwrite      # overwrite | append
    sentimento:
      tag: caller.sentimento_atual
      confidence: 0.80
      merge: overwrite
```

- **inputs**: antes de chamar o LLM / MCP tool, lê `@ctx.<namespace>.<field>` e popula os inputs do step
- **outputs**: após resposta bem-sucedida, extrai campos do output e grava no ContextStore (fire-and-forget)
- **confidence**: confiança default do entry; pode ser sobrescrita por campo

### @ctx.* references in step inputs

Qualquer campo de `input:` ou `message:` pode usar `@ctx.<namespace>.<field>`:

```yaml
input:
  nome_cliente:  "@ctx.caller.nome"       # resolve ContextEntry.value
  historico:     "@ctx.session.historico_mensagens"
message: "{{@ctx.session.ultima_resposta}}"
```

Resolução: lê o hash Redis, parseia o ContextEntry, retorna `entry.value`. Retorna `""` se ausente.

### @ctx.* in choice step conditions

```yaml
conditions:
  - field:     "@ctx.caller.customer_id"
    operator:  exists                # field present with any value
    next:      buscar_crm
  - field:     "@ctx.caller.motivo_contato"
    operator:  confidence_gte        # confidence >= value
    value:     0.7
    next:      finalizar
```

Operadores suportados: `eq`, `ne`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `exists`, `not_exists`, `confidence_gte`.

### required_context (YAML header)

```yaml
required_context:
  caller.nome:
    min_confidence: 0.8
  caller.motivo_contato:
    min_confidence: 0.7
    optional: true
```

O engine pré-computa um `GapsReport` antes do primeiro step e escreve `@ctx.__gaps__` no ContextStore.
O step inicial pode inspecionar os gaps para decidir se precisa coletar dados.

### McpInterceptor auto-accumulation

O `McpInterceptor` (em `@plughub/sdk`) detecta `contextRegistry[serverName][toolName]` e extrai
inputs/outputs automaticamente, antes e depois de cada `callTool()` bem-sucedido.
Os agentes nativos que usam o SDK recebem acumulação de contexto sem código adicional.

### AI Gateway — sentiment_emitter writes

`write_context_store_sentiment(redis, tenant_id, session_id, score)` é chamado dentro de
`SessionManager.update_partial_params` após cada turno LLM.
Escreve dois campos:

| Tag | Valor | Confidence | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `session.sentimento.current` | score arredondado (4 decimais) | 0.80 | `ai_inferred:sentiment_emitter` |
| `session.sentimento.categoria` | "satisfied" / "neutral" / "frustrated" / "angry" | 0.80 | `ai_inferred:sentiment_emitter` |

TTL: 14 400 s (4 horas). Fire-and-forget: nunca levanta exceção.

### supervisor_state — context_snapshot

O MCP tool `supervisor_state` lê o ContextStore diretamente do Redis em vez de buscar
em `pipeline_state.contact_context`. Retorna:

```json
"customer_context": {
  "context_snapshot": {
    "caller.nome":                { "value": "João", "confidence": 0.95, "source": "mcp_call:...", ... },
    "session.sentimento.current": { "value": -0.41, "confidence": 0.80, "source": "ai_inferred:...", ... }
  },
  "contact_context": null   // null quando context_snapshot presente; legacy fallback
}
```

### Agent Assist UI — ContextoTab

A aba "Contexto" detecta automaticamente qual formato usar:
- **`context_snapshot` presente** → renderiza `ContextSnapshotCard` (teal) com campos agrupados por namespace
- **Apenas `contact_context` presente** → renderiza `ContactContextCard` (emerald) — fallback legado

Fontes como `mcp_call:mcp-server-crm:customer_get` são exibidas como "CRM".
Entradas com `visibility: "agents_only"` exibem um badge âmbar 🔒.

### agente_contexto_ia_v1 — versão 2 (simplificada)

A versão 2 do skill usa `choice` com `@ctx.*` em vez de múltiplas chamadas LLM:

```
verificar_gaps (choice):
  @ctx.caller.customer_id exists  → buscar_crm
  @ctx.caller.cpf exists          → buscar_crm
  default                         → verificar_completude

verificar_completude (choice):
  @ctx.caller.motivo_contato confidence_gte 0.7  → finalizar
  default                                         → gerar_pergunta

buscar_crm (invoke: mcp-server-crm/customer_get):
  context_tags.outputs: nome/cpf/account_id/telefone/email/plano_atual/status_conta
  → confidence 0.95, source mcp_call

gerar_pergunta (reason LLM #1):
  context_tags.outputs: pergunta → session.pergunta_coleta

coletar_cliente (menu):
  prompt: "{{@ctx.session.pergunta_coleta}}"

extrair_campos (reason LLM #2):
  context_tags.outputs: todos os campos extraídos → caller.*
```

0 chamadas LLM quando CRM resolve o contexto; no máximo 2 quando é necessário coletar do cliente.

## Channel vs Medium

- **channel** = specific channel (`whatsapp`, `webchat`, `voice`, `email`, `sms`, `instagram`, `telegram`, `webrtc`) — **hard filter** for routing, mandatory match
- **medium** = base type (`voice`, `video`, `message`, `email`) — **score factor**, fine-tuning only

## Canonical stream

`session:{id}:stream` is the single source of truth for all session events.

```
StreamEventType:
  session_opened | session_closed
  participant_joined | participant_left
  customer_identified | medium_transitioned
  message | interaction_request | interaction_result
  flow_step_completed
```

Messages in the stream carry both `content` (masked, delivered to agents) and
`original_content` (unmasked, accessible only by authorised roles for LGPD audit).

## Sentiment tracking

Stored as a score-only array in Redis during the session. Labels are **not** stored — they are calculated at read time using tenant-configurable ranges. Persisted to PostgreSQL (`sentiment_timeline JSONB`) on `session_close`. Never published to the canonical stream.

```
session:{id}:sentiment → [
  { score:  0.40, timestamp: "..." },
  { score: -0.82, timestamp: "..." }
]
TTL: same as session TTL

# Ranges configurable per tenant (applied at read time):
[ 0.3,  1.0] → "satisfied"
[-0.3,  0.3] → "neutral"
[-0.6, -0.3] → "frustrated"
[-1.0, -0.6] → "angry"
```

## Skill Flow — eleven step types

| Type | Does | Interacts with |
|---|---|---|
| `task` | Delegates to agent via A2A (`assist` or `transfer` mode) | Routing Engine |
| `choice` | Conditional branching via JSONPath | pipeline_state |
| `catch` | Retry and fallback before escalation | pipeline_state |
| `escalate` | Routes to pool | Rules Engine |
| `complete` | Closes with defined outcome | agent_done |
| `invoke` | Calls MCP tool directly | MCP Server |
| `reason` | Invokes AI Gateway with output_schema | AI Gateway |
| `notify` | Sends message to customer (unidirectional) | Core → Channel Gateway |
| `menu` | Captures customer input and suspends until reply | Core → Channel Gateway |
| `suspend` | Suspends workflow until external signal (approval, input, webhook, timer) | workflow-api |
| `collect` | Contacts target via channel, awaits response, suspends until replied or expired | workflow-api → Channel Gateway |

### task step modes

| Mode | Mechanism | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `assist` | `session_invite` | Specialist joins as parallel participant |
| `transfer` | `session_escalate` | Full handoff to another agent/pool |

### menu step — interaction modes

| Interaction | Result type | Channels (native) | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| `text` | `string` | All | — |
| `button` | `string` (option id) | WhatsApp (≤3), webchat | Numbered text |
| `list` | `string` (option id) | WhatsApp, webchat | Numbered text |
| `checklist` | `string[]` | Webchat | Comma-separated numbers |
| `form` | `object` | Webchat | Sequential field-by-field |

`timeout`: `0` = immediate return, `>0` = block N seconds, `-1` = block indefinitely.

Fallback collection for unsupported channels happens exclusively in the Channel Gateway
adapter. Skill Flow always receives a single normalised `interaction_result`.

## Routing algorithm — key rules

1. **channel is a hard filter** — allocating an agent that does not support the contact's channel is forbidden
2. **agent pause is a hard filter** — paused agents are excluded from allocation
3. **gateway heartbeat TTL** — agents on gateways with expired heartbeat (>90s) are excluded
4. **SLA lazy evaluation** — `min(wait_time / sla_target, max_score)` calculated only at routing time for the queue head, never periodically
5. **Tie-breaking** — equal-score pools are broken by shortest queue length
6. **close_reason detection** — `no_resource` when no queue configured; `max_wait_exceeded` by lazy evaluation at queue head on every routing event

## Rules Engine — scope

- Consumes: `conversations.routed`, `conversations.queued`, `conversations.abandoned`, `agent.done`
- Publishes: `rules.escalation_triggered`, `rules.notification_triggered`, `rules.session_tagged`
- **Does NOT**: monitor Redis, evaluate sentiment, make routing decisions, maintain state between events

## Kafka event schemas — Zod coverage

All Kafka events that cross package boundaries now have Zod schemas in `@plughub/schemas`.
This enables compile-time validation and IDE autocomplete for producers and consumers.

### New files (added in Zod schema cleanup — ~day 0.5)

| File | Schemas defined |
|---|---|
| `packages/schemas/src/rules-events.ts` | `RulesEvaluationContextSchema`, `RulesEscalationEventSchema`, `RulesActiveEventSchema`, `RulesShadowEventSchema`, `RulesEventSchema` |
| `packages/schemas/src/platform-events.ts` | `RegistryChangedEventSchema`, `ConfigChangedEventSchema`, `SentimentUpdatedEventSchema`, `QueuePositionUpdatedEventSchema`, `RoutingResultEventSchema`, `ConversationRoutedEventSchema`, `AgentLifecycleEventSchema` (discriminated union of 7 variants), `ConversationsEventSchema` (discriminated union of 3 variants) |

### Topic → schema mapping

| Topic | Schema | File |
|---|---|---|
| `rules.escalation.events` | `RulesEscalationEventSchema` (`shadow_mode: false`) | `rules-events.ts` |
| `rules.shadow.events` | `RulesEscalationEventSchema` (`shadow_mode: true`) | `rules-events.ts` |
| `registry.changed` | `RegistryChangedEventSchema` | `platform-events.ts` |
| `config.changed` | `ConfigChangedEventSchema` | `platform-events.ts` |

| `agent.lifecycle` | `AgentLifecycleEventSchema` (discriminated by `event` field) | `platform-events.ts` |
| `conversations.events` | `ConversationsEventSchema` (discriminated by `event_type`) | `platform-events.ts` |
| `workflow.events` | `WorkflowEventSchema` | `workflow.ts` (existing) |

| `mcp.audit` | `AuditRecordSchema` | `audit.ts` (existing) |
| `evaluation.events` | `EvaluationEventSchema` | `evaluation.ts` (Arc 6) |

### Topic name discrepancy note

CLAUDE.md previously documented two Rules Engine topics with incorrect names:
- ❌ `rules.escalation_triggered` → ✅ `rules.escalation.events`
- ❌ `rules.notification_triggered` → ✅ `rules.shadow.events` (with `shadow_mode: true`)

These corrections have been applied to the Kafka topics table above. The actual topic strings are
defined in `packages/rules-engine/src/plughub_rules/kafka_publisher.py`.

### Topics without Zod schemas (not yet wired in production)

These topics appear in the architecture documentation but are not published in the current codebase:

| Topic | Status |
|---|---|
| `conversations.abandoned` | Documented but not published by routing-engine code |
| `conversations.dequeued` | Documented but not published |
| `rules.session_tagged` | Documented but not published |

## Naming conventions

```
skill_id:       skill_{name}_v{n}      →  skill_portabilidade_telco_v2
agent_type_id:  {name}_v{n}            →  agente_retencao_v1
pool_id:        snake_case no version  →  retencao_humano
mcp_server:     mcp-server-{name}      →  mcp-server-crm
tool:           snake_case             →  customer_get
insight:        insight.historico.*    →  customer long-term memory
                insight.conversa.*     →  generated in current session, expires on close
outbound:       outbound.*             →  pending deliveries for Notification Agent
```

## What never to do

- Never create a component that routes conversations without going through the Routing Engine
- Never access Redis directly from outside routing-engine or skill-flow-engine
- Never redefine types from `@plughub/schemas` locally in another package
- Never add business logic to mcp-server-plughub — it only exposes tools
- Never create a dependency on `ai-gateway` in TypeScript packages — only Python consumes it
- Never use `export *` in packages — always explicit named exports
- Never implement channel-specific rendering logic in skill-flow — channel adapters live exclusively in channel-gateway
- Never put form field validation (business rules) inside the `menu` step — validation belongs to subsequent steps
- Never allow a caller to opt out of MCP audit records — audit policy is defined on the tool, not the call
- Never write to `insight.historico.*` directly in PostgreSQL — always via Kafka
- Never inject context into Skill Flow automatically — the caller passes `contact_context` explicitly
- Never expose `original_content` of masked messages to agents — only to authorised roles via audit trail
- Never forward tool calls containing injection patterns — `injection_guard.ts` must be applied before any free-text field reaches a domain MCP server
- Never send tool list to LLM without applying `permissions[]` filter from the JWT — tools not in `permissions` are invisible to the agent
- Never write masked input values to `pipeline_state`, Redis, stream, or logs — `masked_scope` is in-memory only, cleared at `end_transaction`
- Never allow AI agents to emit `@mention` commands — only `role: primary` or `role: human` participants may issue mentions; AI agents use `task` step for coordination
- Never route a `@mention` to a pool not listed in `mentionable_pools` of the origin pool — domain is always closed by pool configuration

## SDK CLI

```bash
plughub-sdk certify            # validates execution contract
plughub-sdk verify-portability # verifies dependency isolation
plughub-sdk regenerate         # regenerates proprietary agent as native
plughub-sdk skill-extract      # extracts skill from existing agent
```

## Operational visibility — section 3.3c

Routing Engine writes a pool snapshot to Redis after every routing event:
```
Key:  {tenant_id}:pool:{pool_id}:snapshot  TTL: 120s
Value: { pool_id, tenant_id, available, queue_length, sla_target_ms, channel_types, updated_at }
```

Three MCP tools (group `operational`) read these snapshots:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `queue_context_get` | Queue position + estimated wait for a queued session |
| `pool_status_get` | Pool availability: agents ready, queue depth, SLA target |
| `system_availability_check` | Cross-channel availability for offering channel switch |

When a contact is queued (no agent available), Routing Engine publishes `queue.position_updated` to Kafka with payload:
```json
{ "event": "queue.position_updated", "session_id", "pool_id", "queue_length",
  "available_agents", "estimated_wait_ms", "sla_target_ms", "published_at" }
```

Estimated wait = `queue_length × (sla_target_ms × 0.7)` — conservative p70 handle-time estimate.

## Security — section 9.5

### Tool permission filtering (AI Gateway)

`InferenceRequest` accepts an optional `permissions: list[str]` field populated from the session JWT.
When non-empty, `InferenceEngine.infer()` filters the `tools` list to only tools whose `name` appears in `permissions` before forwarding to the LLM. Empty list = no filtering (backward-compatible).

### Prompt injection guard (`injection_guard.ts`)

Applied in `mcp-server-plughub` before free-text fields reach domain MCP Servers.
Heuristic regex catalogue (13+ patterns) covering: override/ignore instructions, role hijack, persona pretend, system prompt leak, DAN patterns, developer-mode activation.
`assertNoInjection(toolName, input)` throws with `code: "INJECTION_DETECTED"` on match.
Currently applied in: `notification_send` (message), `conversation_escalate` (pipeline_state).
Future: apply at the PlugHubAdapter / proxy sidecar level for all domain tool calls.

## Message masking — tokenização com partial display

Implementado em `mcp-server-plughub`. ADR completo: `docs/adr/adr-message-masking.md`.

### Token format no stream

```
[{category}:{token_id}:{display_partial}]

[credit_card:tk_a8f3:****1234]           → AI confirma "final 1234" com o cliente
[cpf:tk_b7d2:***-00]                     → AI confirma "termina em 00"
[phone:tk_c1e9:(11) ****-4321]
[email_addr:tk_d4f0:j***@empresa.com]
```

### Componentes

| Arquivo | Responsabilidade |
|---|---|
| `schemas/audit.ts` | `MaskingAccessPolicySchema`, `DEFAULT_MASKING_RULES`, `preserve_pattern` em `MaskingRule` |
| `schemas/message.ts` | `MessageSchema` inclui `original_content: MessageContentSchema.optional()` — campo preservado pelo `SessionContextSchema.parse()` para roles autorizados |
| `mcp-server/lib/token-vault.ts` | Redis token store/resolve — key `{tenant_id}:token:{token_id}`, TTL = sessão |
| `mcp-server/lib/masking.ts` | `MaskingService.applyMasking`, `canReadOriginalContent`, `loadConfig`, `loadAccessPolicy` |
| `mcp-server/tools/session.ts` | `message_send` aplica mascaramento; `session_context_get` monta mensagens completas do stream (event_id→message_id, timestamp, author, visibility + payload) e filtra `original_content` por role |

### Controle de acesso ao `original_content`

- `MaskingAccessPolicy` por tenant — Redis key: `{tenant_id}:masking:access_policy`
- Default: `authorized_roles: ["evaluator", "reviewer"]`
- `primary` e `specialist` recebem token com partial display — operam via MCP Tools
- MCP Tools de domínio resolvem `token_id` → valor via `TokenVault.resolve()`

### Pendentes resolvidos (implementados em task #165)

- ~~Token resolution em MCP Tools de domínio~~: ✅ `McpInterceptorConfig.resolveToken?` — callback opcional que resolve `[category:tk_xxx:display]` nos args antes de encaminhar ao domain server. Fail-open. Wired pelos agentes nativos ao instanciar o interceptor.
- ~~Channel Gateway: exibir só `display_partial` (sem wrapper `[...]`) para o cliente~~: ✅ `_TOKEN_RE` regex + `_strip_tokens()` em `stream_subscriber.py` — aplicado ao texto antes da entrega WebSocket.
- ~~Masking config UI~~: ✅ `packages/platform-ui/src/modules/masking/MaskingPage.tsx` — rota `/config/masking`; 4 seções: controle de acesso (authorized_roles), audit capture (capture_input/output_default), retenção (default_retention_days), visão das categorias. `MaskingService.loadAccessPolicy()` atualizado com fallback chain: legacy key → Config API tenant cache → Config API global cache → hardcoded default.

### Arquitetura do modelo de mascaramento

O stream canônico (`session:{id}:stream`) armazena dois campos por mensagem:
- `content` — versão mascarada entregue ao agente (tokens inline `[cpf:tk_xxx:***-00]`)
- `original_content` — versão original acessível apenas por `authorized_roles` via `session_context_get`

O mascaramento é aplicado na **escrita** (`message_send`) e o controle de acesso ao valor original é feito na **leitura** por role. Para entrega ao cliente via WebSocket, `_strip_tokens()` extrai apenas o `display_partial` dos tokens — o cliente nunca vê o wrapper `[...]`.

## @mention — protocolo de endereçamento de participantes

Permite que agentes humanos enviem comandos a qualquer agente especialista em conferência usando sintaxe `@alias`. Spec completa: `docs/guias/mention-protocol.md`.

### Regras fundamentais

- Apenas `role: primary` ou `role: human` podem emitir mentions com efeito de roteamento
- O domínio de aliases possíveis é fechado pela configuração `mentionable_pools` do pool de origem
- A mensagem é sempre entregue a todos os participantes `agents_only` — o roteamento é adicional, não substitutivo
- A confirmação de convite é o evento `participant_joined` (já existente) — sem ack separado

### Pool configuration

```yaml
pools:
  - id: retencao_humano
    mentionable_pools:
      copilot:  copilot_retencao     # @copilot → recruta do pool copilot_retencao
      billing:  billing_especialista # @billing → recruta do pool billing_especialista
```

### Sintaxe com interpolação de contexto

```
@billing conta=@ctx.caller.account_id motivo=@ctx.caller.motivo_contato
@copilot cliente tem plano @ctx.caller.plano_atual|"não identificado"
@billing @suporte analise o contexto    ← múltiplos destinatários
```

Referências `@ctx.*` são resolvidas pelo mcp-server-plughub antes do roteamento. Fallback inline: `@ctx.campo|"default"`.

### `mention_commands` no skill YAML

```yaml
mention_commands:
  ativa:
    action:
      set_context: { session.copilot.mode: "active" }
    acknowledge: true
  pausa:
    action:
      set_context: { session.copilot.mode: "passive" }
    acknowledge: true
  para:
    action:
      terminate_self: true
```

Ações disponíveis: `set_context` (escreve no ContextStore), `trigger_step` (salta para step do flow), `terminate_self` (agente sai da conferência).

---

## Masked Input — captura segura de dados sensíveis

Garante que dados altamente sensíveis (senhas, PINs, OTPs) nunca entrem no stream, `pipeline_state`, Redis ou logs. Spec completa: `docs/guias/masked-input.md`.

### Atributo `masked` no menu step

```yaml
- id: coletar_senha
  type: menu
  interaction: form
  masked: true                    # step-level: todos os campos
  fields:
    - id: senha
      masked: true                # ou field-level individual
```

### `begin_transaction` / `end_transaction`

Toda captura sensível → validação → ação é uma unidade atômica. Falha em qualquer step dentro do bloco descarta o `masked_scope` e executa `on_failure`.

```yaml
- id: tx_inicio
  type: begin_transaction
  on_failure: coletar_senha       # rewind explícito — nunca inferido

- id: coletar_senha
  type: menu
  masked: true
  ...

- id: validar
  type: invoke
  input:
    senha: "@masked.senha"        # namespace @masked.* — lê do scope em memória

- id: tx_fim
  type: end_transaction           # caminho feliz — rollback é sempre implícito
  result_as: operacao_status
```

### Invariantes

- `masked_scope` existe apenas em memória — nunca escrito em Redis, `pipeline_state` ou stream
- `end_transaction` é exclusivamente o caminho de sucesso; rollback é automático e implícito
- `reason` step dentro de bloco masked é erro de design, rejeitado pelo agent-registry
- Retry nunca re-usa valor mascarado — recoleta sempre exige nova entrada do usuário
- Audit record inclui `masked_input_fields: string[]` registrando quais campos foram omitidos
- Channels sem `supports_masked_input` executam `masked_fallback` — nunca tentam renderizar o formulário

### ChannelCapabilities

```typescript
supports_masked_input?: boolean   // default: false
masked_fallback?: "message" | "link" | "decline"
```

| Canal | Suporte | Comportamento |
|---|---|---|
| `webchat` | `true` | Overlay fora do chat; `<input type="password">`; placeholder no replay |
| `whatsapp` | `false` | `masked_fallback` configurado |
| `voice` | `true` | DTMF nativo — semântico |
| `sms`, `email` | `false` | `masked_fallback` configurado |

## Session Replayer — avaliação de qualidade pós-sessão

Implementado em `packages/session-replayer/`. ADR completo: `docs/adr/adr-session-replayer.md`.

### Padrão: ensure-before-read com Hydrator opcional

```
conversations.session_closed
  → Stream Persister (PostgreSQL)
  → evaluation.requested
      → Stream Hydrator  (Redis hit: no-op | Redis miss: reconstrói do PG)
      → Replayer         (sempre lê Redis)
          → ReplayContext em {tenant_id}:replay:{session_id}:context  TTL: 1h
          → Evaluator agent: evaluation_context_get → evaluation_submit
          → evaluation.events (Kafka) → consumer → PostgreSQL
```

### Componentes

| Módulo | Responsabilidade |
|--------|-----------------|
| `stream_persister.py` | `session_closed` → `session_stream_events` (PostgreSQL) |
| `stream_hydrator.py`  | `ensure(session_id)` — Redis hit: no-op; Redis miss: PG → Redis |
| `replayer.py`         | Lê Redis, calcula `delta_ms`, escreve `ReplayContext` |
| `consumer.py`         | Kafka: persister (session_closed) + replayer (evaluation.requested) |
| `evaluation_context_get` | MCP Tool — evaluator lê `ReplayContext` (inclui `original_content`) |
| `evaluation_submit`   | MCP Tool — publica `EvaluationResult` em `evaluation.events` |

### Componentes adicionais (Comparison Mode)

| Módulo | Responsabilidade |
|--------|-----------------|
| `comparator.py` | Jaccard similarity turn-a-turn, produz `ComparisonReport` — sem I/O |
| `ReplayContext.comparison_mode` | Flag que sinaliza ao evaluator para fornecer `comparison_turns` |
| `evaluation_submit.comparison_turns` | Input opcional com pares (production_text, replay_text) |
| `buildComparisonReport()` | Função TypeScript inline em `evaluation.ts` — computa similarity + deltas |

### Schemas novos em `@plughub/schemas`

`EvaluationDimension`, `EvaluationResult`, `ReplayEvent`, `ReplayContext`,
`EvaluationRequest`, `ComparisonReport`

### Comparison Mode — fluxo completo

```
ReplayContext.comparison_mode: true
  → evaluator recebe flag via evaluation_context_get
  → evaluator gera comparison_turns: [{turn_index, production_text, replay_text, latency_ms?}]
  → evaluation_submit(comparison_turns, comparison_replay_outcome?, comparison_replay_sentiment?)
      → buildComparisonReport() — Jaccard, divergence_points (threshold=0.4), deltas
      → EvaluationResult.comparison = ComparisonReport
      → event_type: "evaluation.completed" publicado com .comparison presente
  → resultado retorna comparison_included: true
```

### Jaccard similarity

Coeficiente J(A,B) = |A ∩ B| / |A ∪ B| sobre tokens normalizados (lowercase, sem pontuação).
Sem dependências externas. Determinístico. Threshold default: 0.4.
Casos especiais: ambos vazios → 1.0; um vazio → 0.0.

### Timing fiel

`ReplayEvent.delta_ms` preserva o intervalo original entre eventos.
`speed_factor` escala o timing: `1.0` = real-time, `10.0` = default batch.

### Tests

- `session-replayer/tests/test_comparator.py` — 22 unit tests (pytest): Jaccard, compare, deltas, to_dict, threshold inválido

## Usage Metering — metering ≠ pricing

Implementado em `packages/usage-aggregator/`. Princípio: cada componente registra o que consumiu;
um módulo de pricing separado (a construir) lê esses dados e decide o que cobrar.

### Tópico Kafka: usage.events

Schema em `@plughub/schemas/usage.ts` — `UsageEventSchema`. Campos: `event_id`, `tenant_id`,
`session_id`, `dimension`, `quantity`, `timestamp`, `source_component`, `metadata`.
Sem `unit_price_cents` ou `plan_id` — esses campos pertencem ao módulo de pricing.

### Dimensões implementadas

| Dimensão | Unidade | Publicado por |
|---|---|---|
| `sessions` | por sessão atendida | Core (`agent_busy`) — guard SET NX anti-duplicata |
| `messages` | por mensagem `visibility: "all"` | Core (`message_send`) |
| `llm_tokens_input` | tokens de prompt | AI Gateway (`inference.py`) |
| `llm_tokens_output` | tokens de resposta | AI Gateway (`inference.py`) |
| `whatsapp_conversations`, `voice_minutes`, `sms_segments`, `email_messages` | por canal | Channel Gateway (pendente) |

### Componentes

| Arquivo | Responsabilidade |
|---|---|
| `schemas/usage.ts` | `UsageEventSchema`, `QuotaLimitSchema`, `UsageCycleResetSchema` + schemas de metadata por dimensão |
| `mcp-server/lib/usage-emitter.ts` | `emitSessionOpened`, `emitMessageSent` — fire-and-forget via Kafka |
| `ai-gateway/usage_emitter.py` | `emit_llm_tokens` — dois eventos separados (input/output) por inferência |
| `providers/base.py` | `LLMResponse` com `input_tokens` e `output_tokens` |
| `usage-aggregator/aggregator.py` | `UsageAggregator.process()` — INCRBY Redis + INSERT PostgreSQL |
| `usage-aggregator/consumer.py` | Kafka consumer `usage.events` + `_ensure_schema()` para DDL |
| `mcp-server/lib/quota-check.ts` | `assertQuota` (INCRBY-check-rollback) + `checkConcurrentSessions` |

### Redis keys de metering

| Chave | Conteúdo | TTL |
|---|---|---|
| `{t}:usage:current:{dimension}` | Counter INCRBY por ciclo | 45 dias |
| `{t}:usage:cycle_start` | ISO 8601 início do ciclo | 45 dias |
| `{t}:quota:limit:{dimension}` | Limite operacional (escrito pelo operador ou pricing) | sem TTL |
| `{t}:quota:max_concurrent_sessions` | Limite de sessões simultâneas | sem TTL |
| `{t}:quota:concurrent_sessions` | Gauge atual (INCR/DECR pelo Core) | 6h |
| `{t}:usage:session:{session_id}:counted` | Guard de idempotência para `sessions` | 5h |

### Tests

- `usage-aggregator/tests/test_aggregator.py` — 10 unit tests (pytest): Redis INCRBY, idempotência, graceful degradation, `_truncate_to_hour`
- `mcp-server/src/__tests__/quota-check.test.ts` — 13 unit tests (vitest): `assertQuota` + `checkConcurrentSessions`
- `e2e-tests/scenarios/regressions.ts` — 2 regression cases documentados (R1: ZodError em `session_context_get`, R2: parsing de `callTool()`)

### Pendente neste módulo

- Publicação de `usage.events` no Channel Gateway (voice, WhatsApp, SMS)
- Módulo de pricing: lê contadores + aplica planos + escreve `{t}:quota:limit:*`
- ~~`usage.cycle_reset` — reset mensal de contadores~~ ✅ `cycle_reset.py` + consumer `usage.cycle_reset` topic + `POST /admin/cycle-reset` (HTTP admin FastAPI — porta 3950)

## WebChat Channel — hybrid stream model

Implementado em `packages/channel-gateway/`. Três canais distintos: `webchat`, `webrtc`, `whatsapp` — mantidos separados porque `channel` é filtro hard no roteamento.

### Protocolo WebSocket (typed envelope)

```
Cliente → Servidor
  conn.authenticate  {token, cursor?}   — primeira mensagem após conn.hello
  msg.text           {id, text}
  msg.image          {id, file_id, caption?}
  msg.document       {id, file_id, caption?}
  msg.video          {id, file_id, caption?}
  upload.request     {id, file_name, mime_type, size_bytes}
  menu.submit        {menu_id, interaction, result}
  conn.ping                             — keepalive do cliente

Servidor → Cliente
  conn.hello         {server_version}   — imediato após accept
  conn.authenticated {contact_id, session_id, stream_cursor}
  conn.error         {code, message}    — falha de autenticação
  conn.pong                             — resposta ao conn.ping
  upload.ready       {request_id, file_id, upload_url}
  upload.committed   {file_id, url, mime_type, size_bytes, content_type}
  msg.text / msg.image / msg.document / msg.video  — entrega do stream
  interaction.request {menu_id, interaction, prompt, options?, fields?}
  presence.typing_start  {participant_id, role}
  presence.agent_joined  {participant_id, role}
  conn.session_ended {reason}
```

Token (JWT HS256) vai no corpo da mensagem — nunca na URL (evita logs de acesso).

### Hybrid stream model — por que não participante nomeado

O cliente webchat NÃO é registrado como participante na sessão. Em vez disso, o Channel Gateway faz XREAD bloqueante direto no `session:{id}:stream`. Vantagens:
- Reconnect por cursor: `XRANGE session:{id}:stream {cursor} +` — zero mensagens perdidas
- Sem propagação de role `customer` por todas as MCP Tools
- Sem complexidade de multi-tab (cada tab tem cursor próprio)
- Typing indicators efêmeros ficam no pub/sub `session:{id}:typing` — não poluem o stream

### WebchatAdapter — três tasks concorrentes

```python
receive_task  = _receive_loop()         # inbound do cliente → conversations.inbound
delivery_task = _stream_delivery_loop() # XREAD session stream → ws.send_json
typing_task   = _typing_listener()      # pub/sub typing → presence.*
asyncio.wait({receive, delivery, typing}, FIRST_COMPLETED) → cancel outros → _close
```

### Upload de arquivos — dois estágios

```
1. WS:  upload.request {file_name, mime_type, size_bytes}
2. WS:  upload.ready   {request_id, file_id, upload_url}
3. HTTP: POST /webchat/v1/upload/{file_id} (binary)
4. WS:  upload.committed {file_id, url, content_type}
5. WS:  msg.image|document|video {file_id, caption?}
```

### AttachmentStore — interface estável

| Fase | Implementação | Storage |
|---|---|---|
| Fase 1 | `FilesystemAttachmentStore` | Disco local + PostgreSQL (metadata) |
| Fase 2 | `S3AttachmentStore` | S3/MinIO (interface inalterada) |

Path: `{STORAGE_ROOT}/{tenant_id}/{YYYY}/{MM}/{DD}/{session_id}/{file_id}.{ext}`

MIME allowlist: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp, image/gif (16 MB), application/pdf (100 MB), video/mp4, video/webm (512 MB).

Cron de expurgo dois estágios: Estágio 1 (horário) soft-delete; Estágio 2 (diário, grace 24h) delete físico.

### Rotas HTTP

| Rota | Descrição |
|---|---|
| `POST /webchat/v1/upload/{file_id}` | Recebe binário, chama `store.commit()`, envia `upload.committed` via WS |
| `GET  /webchat/v1/attachments/{file_id}` | Streaming do arquivo; 410 Gone se expirado |

### Tests

- `tests/test_webchat_adapter.py` — 28 testes pytest (auth handshake, lifecycle, text/media/upload/menu, heartbeat, close_from_platform)
- `tests/test_stream_subscriber.py` — 25 testes pytest (cursor tracking, filtro de visibilidade, mapeamento de todos os tipos de evento, resiliência a erros e cancelamento)
- `tests/test_attachment_store.py` — 59 testes pytest (validate_mime, magic_bytes, reserve, commit, resolve, soft_expire, stream_bytes — FilesystemAttachmentStore + S3AttachmentStore; asyncpg mockado, filesystem real via tmp_path)
- `tests/test_models.py` — 136 testes totais no pacote channel-gateway

### Masked fields delivery chain

`masked_fields` propagates from the Skill Flow Engine through the full delivery stack:

| Layer | File | Change |
|---|---|---|
| Skill Flow Engine | `skill-flow-engine/src/steps/menu.ts` | Computes `maskedFieldIds[]` from `step.masked` + field-level `field.masked`, passes to `notification_send` |
| BPM tool | `mcp-server-plughub/src/tools/bpm.ts` | Reads `masked_fields` from `notification_send` args, includes in `conversations.outbound` Kafka payload |
| Channel Gateway models | `channel-gateway/models.py` | `WsMenuRender.masked_fields: list[str] \| None` |
| Outbound consumer | `channel-gateway/outbound_consumer.py` | Extracts `masked_fields`, logs warning for non-webchat channels, passes to `WsMenuRender` |
| Stream subscriber | `channel-gateway/stream_subscriber.py` | Conditionally adds `masked_fields` to `interaction.request` WS event |

WebChat renders masked fields as `<input type="password">` overlay (outside chat transcript).
Non-webchat channels use `masked_fallback` (configured per channel).

### Usage Metering — Channel Gateway

Implementado em `usage_emitter.py`. Dimensões publicadas em `usage.events`:

| Dimensão | Quantidade | Publicado por | Quando |
|---|---|---|---|
| `whatsapp_conversations` | 1 por conversa | adapter WhatsApp (futuro) | contact_open |
| `voice_minutes` | ceil(segundos/60) | adapter WebRTC/Voice (futuro) | contact_close |
| `sms_segments` | 1 por segmento | adapter SMS (futuro) | inbound/outbound |
| `email_messages` | 1 por mensagem | adapter Email (futuro) | inbound/outbound |
| `webchat_attachments` | 1 por arquivo | `upload_router.py` | após store.commit() |

`webchat_attachments` é a única dimensão atualmente wired (commit de arquivo no upload flow).
As demais funções estão implementadas e documentadas, prontas para os adapters futuros.

Tests: `tests/test_usage_emitter.py` — 22 testes (todas as dimensões + error path).

### Novas dependências

`PyJWT>=2.8.0`, `asyncpg>=0.29.0`, `aiofiles>=23.2.1`

### Novos campos em Settings

| Campo | Padrão | Descrição |
|---|---|---|
| `jwt_secret` | `changeme_...` | Segredo HS256 para validar tokens de cliente |
| `ws_auth_timeout_s` | `30` | Timeout para receber conn.authenticate |
| `storage_root` | `/var/plughub/attachments` | Raiz dos arquivos de upload |
| `attachment_expiry_days` | `30` | TTL dos uploads |
| `database_url` | `postgresql://...` | DSN PostgreSQL para metadados |
| `webchat_serving_base_url` | `http://localhost:8010/...` | URL pública de download |
| `webchat_upload_base_url` | `http://localhost:8010/...` | URL de upload HTTP |

### Reconexão — casos pendentes (fase 2)

- ~~**Stream TTL expirado pós-session_ended**~~: ✅ `StreamExpiredError` levantado em `StreamSubscriber.messages()` quando cliente reconecta com cursor != "0" mas `EXISTS session:{id}:stream` retorna 0. `_stream_delivery_loop` captura e envia `{"type": "conn.session_ended", "reason": "session_expired"}`. Falha no EXISTS presume que stream existe (graceful degradation).
- ~~**jwt_secret por tenant**~~: ✅ `_decode_token` agora async: (1) decode sem verificação para ler `tenant_id`; (2) lookup Redis `{tenant_id}:config:webchat:jwt_secret`; (3) fallback para `settings.jwt_secret`. Single-tenant sem mudança de config. Tests: `TestStreamExpiredReconnect` (2 cases) + `TestMultiTenantJwtSecret` (3 cases). Total channel-gateway: 198/198 (incl. magic bytes + S3 tests).

## Pricing Module — capacity-based billing

Implementado em `packages/pricing-api/` (Python FastAPI, porta 3900). Princípio: cobrança por capacidade configurada, não por consumo. Dados de consumo variável permanecem visíveis no painel para curadoria de qualidade, mas não entram no cálculo de faturamento.

### Modelo de cobrança

Dois componentes:

| Componente | Descrição | Granularidade |
|---|---|---|
| **Base capacity** | Recursos sempre ativos (ai_agent, human_agent, whatsapp_number, etc.) | Mensal proporcional (dias úteis no ciclo) |
| **Reserve pools** | Capacidade adicional ativada/desativada manualmente | Dia inteiro por ativação (full-day billing) |

**Full-day billing para reserve pools**: se um pool é ativado em qualquer momento do dia D, o dia D inteiro é faturável. O detalhe de ativação/desativação é persistido em `pricing.reserve_activation_log` com datas de tipo `DATE` (sem horário).

### PostgreSQL schema

```sql
-- Recursos configurados por instalação
CREATE TABLE pricing.installation_resources (
    id               UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    tenant_id        TEXT NOT NULL,
    installation_id  TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'default',
    resource_type    TEXT NOT NULL,  -- ai_agent | human_agent | whatsapp_number | ...
    quantity         INT  NOT NULL,
    pool_type        TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'base',  -- base | reserve
    reserve_pool_id  TEXT,           -- pool lógico para agrupar recursos de reserva
    active           BOOL NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
    billing_unit     TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'monthly',
    label            TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    created_at       TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at       TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- Log de ativações de reserve pools (full-day billing)
CREATE TABLE pricing.reserve_activation_log (
    id                 UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    tenant_id          TEXT NOT NULL,
    reserve_pool_id    TEXT NOT NULL,
    activation_date    DATE NOT NULL,
    deactivation_date  DATE,          -- NULL = ainda ativo
    activated_by       TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'operator',
    created_at         TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
    UNIQUE (tenant_id, reserve_pool_id, activation_date)
);
```

### Preços padrão (Config API — namespace `pricing`)

| Recurso | Preço mensal (BRL) |
|---|---|
| `ai_agent` | 120,00 |
| `human_agent` | 50,00 |
| `whatsapp_number` | 15,00 |
| `voice_trunk_in` | 40,00 |
| `voice_trunk_out` | 40,00 |
| `email_inbox` | 25,00 |
| `sms_number` | 10,00 |
| `webchat_instance` | 20,00 |

`reserve_markup_pct` (padrão `0.0`): surcharge percentual aplicado ao preço de reserve pools.
`billing_cycle_day` (padrão `1`): dia do mês em que o ciclo de cobrança se inicia.

### Cálculo de fatura

```
# Base items
daily_rate  = unit_price / billing_days
subtotal    = daily_rate × quantity × billing_days   # (sempre billing_days para base)

# Reserve items
reserve_unit = unit_price × (1 + reserve_markup_pct / 100)
reserve_daily = reserve_unit / billing_days
subtotal      = reserve_daily × quantity × days_active  # days_active = dias distintos do log
```

### Endpoints

| Método | Rota | Descrição |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/v1/pricing/invoice/{tenant_id}` | Fatura em JSON (ciclo atual ou explícito) |
| `GET` | `/v1/pricing/invoice/{tenant_id}?format=xlsx` | Export XLSX com layout de fatura |
| `GET` | `/v1/pricing/resources/{tenant_id}` | Lista recursos configurados |
| `POST` | `/v1/pricing/resources/{tenant_id}` | Upsert recurso (admin) |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/pricing/resources/{tenant_id}/{resource_id}` | Remove recurso (admin) |
| `POST` | `/v1/pricing/reserve/{tenant_id}/{pool_id}/activate` | Ativa reserve pool (admin) |
| `POST` | `/v1/pricing/reserve/{tenant_id}/{pool_id}/deactivate` | Desativa reserve pool (admin) |
| `GET` | `/v1/pricing/reserve/{tenant_id}/activity` | Log de ativações |

Auth: `X-Admin-Token` header verificado contra `Settings.admin_token` (vazio = sem auth).

### Arquivos principais

| Arquivo | Responsabilidade |
|---|---|
| `db.py` | DDL + CRUD: `list_resources`, `upsert_resource`, `delete_resource`, `set_reserve_active`, `record_activation`, `record_deactivation`, `list_activation_log`, `count_active_days` |
| `calculator.py` | `PricingCalculator.calculate()` → `Invoice` dataclass; `invoice_to_xlsx()` openpyxl; `load_price_table()` via Config API com fallback |
| `router.py` | FastAPI endpoints, `require_admin` dependency, `load_price_table` importado do calculator |
| `main.py` | FastAPI app + lifecycle startup/shutdown (asyncpg pool) |
| `config.py` | `Settings` com prefixo `PLUGHUB_PRICING_`; `config_api_url`, `admin_token`, `port` |
| `tests/test_calculator.py` | 23 unit tests: TestUnitPrice, TestBaseCalculation, TestReserveCalculation, TestBillingCycle, TestInvoiceToDict, TestXlsxExport |
| `tests/test_router.py` | 16 integration tests: TestHealth, TestGetInvoice (4), TestResources (5), TestReserveActivation (4), TestActivationLog (2) |

Total: **39/39 testes passando**.

### Operator Console — PricingPanel

`packages/operator-console/src/components/PricingPanel.tsx` — dois tabs:

- **Invoice tab**: tabela de base items + grupos de reserve pools com toggle Activate/Deactivate; totais por seção; GrandTotal em destaque; botão export XLSX via link direto `?format=xlsx`.
- **Consumption tab**: dados de `GET /reports/usage` da analytics-api; agrega por dimensão com nota explícita "não incluído no faturamento — disponível para curadoria de qualidade".
- **ResourceSidebar**: lista de recursos agrupados por pool_type + campo de admin token local.

Hooks: `packages/operator-console/src/api/pricing-hooks.ts` — `useInvoice`, `useResources`, `useActivationLog`, `activateReservePool`, `deactivateReservePool`. Todos usam URL relativa (`VITE_PRICING_API_BASE_URL ?? ''`) para proxy Vite.

Proxy Vite: `/v1/pricing` → `http://localhost:3900`.

### Config API — namespace `pricing`

Quatro chaves seedadas em `packages/config-api/src/plughub_config_api/seed.py`:
- `pricing.currency` — `"BRL"`
- `pricing.unit_prices` — mapa recurso→preço mensal
- `pricing.reserve_markup_pct` — `0.0`
- `pricing.billing_cycle_day` — `1`

Editáveis por tenant via ConfigPanel do Operator Console (namespace `pricing`).

## Pool Lifecycle Hooks

Permite que pools humanos declarem agentes especialistas que são ativados automaticamente
em pontos específicos do ciclo de atendimento, substituindo lógica hardcoded no Agent Assist UI.

### Schema — `@plughub/schemas/agent-registry.ts`

```typescript
PoolHookEntry { pool: string }   // pool_id do especialista a recrutar

PoolHooks {
  on_human_start: PoolHookEntry[]   // agente humano entra na sessão
  on_human_end:   PoolHookEntry[]   // agente humano chama agent_done (Fase B)
  post_human:     PoolHookEntry[]   // após on_human_end concluir (Fase B)
}
```

Declarado em `PoolRegistrationSchema.hooks?: PoolHooksSchema`.
O campo `copilot_skill_id` é `@deprecated` — substituído por `hooks.on_human_start`.

### Mecanismo de dispatch

O orchestrator-bridge despacha hooks publicando um `ConversationInboundEvent` sintético
no tópico `conversations.inbound` com `conference_id` preenchido:

```
hooks.on_human_start: [{pool: copilot_sac}]
  → bridge publica conversations.inbound { pool_id: "copilot_sac", conference_id: uuid }
  → routing engine aloca instância do pool copilot_sac
  → routing engine publica conversations.routed com conference_id
  → bridge recebe routed → process_routed → activate_native_agent (conference path)
```

Reutiliza 100% da infra de conferência/@mention — sem nova lógica de roteamento.

### Kafka producer no bridge

`_kafka_producer: AIOKafkaProducer` — variável de módulo inicializada em `run()`.
Usada por `fire_pool_hooks()` e `_trigger_contact_close()`.

### Trigger points implementados

| Hook | Status | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `on_human_start` | ✅ Fase A | Após `activate_human_agent()` em `process_routed()` |
| `on_human_end` | ✅ Fase B | `process_contact_event` agent_closed, last human drops → `fire_pool_hooks("on_human_end")` |
| `post_human` | ✅ Fase C | `on_human_end` pending reaches 0 → `fire_pool_hooks("post_human")` → pending reaches 0 → `_trigger_contact_close()` |

### Configuração (tenant_demo.yaml)

```yaml
pools:
  - pool_id: retencao_humano
    hooks:
      on_human_start: []          # vazio: copilot ativado via @mention
      on_human_end:
        - pool: finalizacao_ia    # agente NPS + encerramento (Fase B)
      post_human: []

  - pool_id: finalizacao_ia
    description: "NPS + encerramento após agente humano"
    channel_types: [webchat, whatsapp]
    sla_target_ms: 120000
```

### Agente de finalização (`agente_finalizacao_v1`)

Skill: `packages/skill-flow-engine/skills/agente_finalizacao_v1.yaml`

Fluxo:
```
agradecimento (notify) → solicitar_nps (menu button, timeout 60s)
  → registrar_nps (notify + context_tag session.nps_score_raw)
  → encerrar (complete resolved)
  [timeout/failure] → encerrar (complete resolved)
```

Ativação: via `on_human_end` hook em `retencao_humano` — ✅ wired (Fase B completa).

### Fase B — separação agent_done / contact_close (✅ implementado)

O human `agent_done` (REST `/agent_done`) NÃO mais fecha o WebSocket do cliente.
O bridge assume a propriedade do close e o atrasa até os hook agents concluírem.

**Fluxo completo:**
```
Humano clica "Encerrar"
  → mcp-server POST /agent_done (publica contact_closed reason="agent_closed")
  → process_contact_event(agent_closed): último humano → clear human_agent flags
      → get_pool_config → on_human_end hooks?
          Sim → fire_pool_hooks("on_human_end")
                  → publica conversations.inbound com conference_id por hook
                  → seta session:{id}:hook_pending:on_human_end = N
                  → seta session:{id}:hook_conf:{conf_id} por hook
          Não → asyncio.create_task(_trigger_contact_close())
  → process_routed recebe o hook agent ativado
      → activate_native_agent (agente_finalizacao_v1 executa: NPS + encerramento)
      → ao retornar: getdel hook_conf → decr hook_pending
          → pending == 0 → asyncio.create_task(_trigger_contact_close())
  → _trigger_contact_close():
      → publica conversations.outbound session.closed → channel-gateway fecha WS do cliente
      → publica conversations.events contact_closed reason="agent_done" → limpeza completa
```

**Redis keys de controle:**
| Key | TTL | Descrição |
|---|---|---|
| `session:{id}:hook_pending:on_human_end` | 4h | Counter de hooks pendentes |
| `session:{id}:hook_conf:{conference_id}` | 4h | Marca hook-spawned agents |

**Mudança em mcp-server `/agent_done`:** removida a publicação de `conversations.outbound session.closed`. O bridge passou a ser o único dono do close do WebSocket do cliente após o `on_human_end`.

### Fase C — participation analytics + post_human hook dispatch (✅ implementado)

**Kafka topic:** `conversations.participants` — publicado pelo orchestrator-bridge.

**Producer (orchestrator-bridge/main.py):**
- `_publish_participant_event()` — fire-and-forget helper, publica em `TOPIC_PARTICIPANTS`
- `activate_human_agent()` → publica `participant_joined`, armazena `participant_joined_at:{instance_id}` (Redis, TTL 4h)
- `activate_native_agent()` → publica `participant_joined` (antes) + `participant_left` com duration_ms (após)
- `process_contact_event(agent_closed)` → lê `participant_joined_at:{instance_id}` via GETDEL, calcula `duration_ms`, publica `participant_left`

**Payload de evento:**
```json
{
  "type":           "participant_joined" | "participant_left",
  "event_id":       "uuid",
  "session_id":     "sess_...",
  "tenant_id":      "tenant_demo",
  "participant_id": "agente_retencao_v1-001",
  "pool_id":        "retencao_humano",
  "agent_type_id":  "agente_retencao_v1",
  "role":           "primary" | "specialist",
  "agent_type":     "ai" | "human",
  "conference_id":  "conf_..." | null,
  "joined_at":      "ISO8601",
  "duration_ms":    180000 | null,
  "timestamp":      "ISO8601"
}
```

**Consumer (analytics-api):**
- `parse_participant_event()` em `models.py` — mapeia `participant_joined`/`participant_left` → `participation_intervals`
- `"conversations.participants"` em `_TOPICS` e `_PARSERS`
- `_write_row()` despacha `participation_intervals` → `store.upsert_participation_interval()`

**ClickHouse — participation_intervals:**
```sql
ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(left_at)
ORDER BY (tenant_id, session_id, participant_id)
```
`participant_joined` escreve com `left_at=NULL`; `participant_left` escreve com `left_at` preenchido.
Background merge seleciona a versão com maior `left_at` (non-NULL wins).

**API:** `GET /reports/participation` — filtros: `session_id`, `pool_id`, `agent_type_id`, `role`. Suporta `format=csv`.

**Kafka topics adicionados ao docker-compose:** `conversations.participants` em `docker-compose.test.yml`, `docker-compose.full.yml`, `docker-compose.demo.yml`.

**post_human dispatch:** quando `on_human_end` pending chega a 0, o bridge verifica `post_human` hooks no `pool_config`:
- Se existirem → `fire_pool_hooks("post_human")` — mesmo mecanismo de `on_human_end`
- Quando `post_human` pending chega a 0 → `_trigger_contact_close()`
- Se não existirem → `_trigger_contact_close()` diretamente

**Redis keys adicionais:**
| Key | TTL | Descrição |
|---|---|---|
| `session:{id}:hook_pending:post_human` | 4h | Counter de post_human hooks |
| `participant_joined_at:{instance_id}` | 4h | Timestamp ISO8601 de entrada do participante |

**Tests:**
- `test_consumer.py`: `TestParseParticipantEvent` (8 assertions), `TestWriteRowDispatch::test_participation_intervals_dispatched`
- `test_reports.py`: `TestQueryParticipationReport` (4 assertions)

## Frontend Architecture — platform-ui as standard shell

All operator-facing UI lives in `packages/platform-ui/`. Never create standalone frontend packages.

### Shell structure

```
packages/platform-ui/
  src/
    app/          ← App.tsx, routes.tsx (React Router v6)
    auth/         ← AuthContext, useAuth, ProtectedRoute, LoginPage
    components/ui/ ← Button, Card, Table, Badge, Modal, Input, Select, Spinner, PageHeader, EmptyState
    modules/      ← one subfolder per route module
    shell/        ← Shell.tsx (layout), Sidebar.tsx, TopBar.tsx
    i18n/         ← pt-BR (default), en locale files
```

### Design tokens (Tailwind)

| Token | Hex | Uso |
|---|---|---|
| `primary` | `#1B4F8A` | Sidebar, botões principais, links primários |
| `secondary` | `#2D9CDB` | Ações secundárias, badges informativos |
| `accent` | `#00B4D8` | Destaques, hover states |
| `green` | `#059669` | Sucesso, status ativo |
| `warning` | `#D97706` | Alertas, estados de atenção |
| `red` | `#DC2626` | Erros, estados críticos |

Font: Inter (via Google Fonts). Never write hex colors inline — always use Tailwind tokens.

### Adding a new module

1. Create `src/modules/{name}/{ModulePage}.tsx` — use only components from `@/components/ui/`
2. Register route in `src/app/routes.tsx` as a child of the Shell route
3. Add `NavItem` to `navItems[]` in `src/shell/Sidebar.tsx` with `roles` filter

```typescript
// routes.tsx — add to children array
{ path: 'config/billing', element: <BillingPage /> }

// Sidebar.tsx — add to navItems array
{ label: t('nav.billing'), href: '/config/billing', icon: '💳', roles: ['admin'] }
```

### Auth pattern

```typescript
import { useAuth } from '@/auth/useAuth'
const { session } = useAuth()  // session.role: 'operator' | 'supervisor' | 'admin' | 'developer' | 'business'
```

### Roles

| Role | Acesso |
|---|---|
| `operator` | Monitor, Agent Assist, Analytics |
| `supervisor` | operator + Avaliação, Relatórios |
| `admin` | supervisor + Configuração, Skill Flows |
| `developer` | admin + Developer Tools |
| `business` | Home, Analytics, Business |

### Migrated panels — config-recursos tabs

The `packages/platform-ui/src/modules/config-recursos/` tab container holds 6 tabs:

| Tab | File | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Pools | `PoolsPage.tsx` | Pool CRUD |
| Agent Types | `AgentTypesPage.tsx` | AgentType CRUD |
| Skills | `SkillsPage.tsx` | Skill list + detail |
| Instances | `InstancesPage.tsx` | Running instances (read-only) |
| Canais | `ChannelsPage.tsx` | GatewayConfig CRUD (8 channel types), migrated from operator-console ChannelPanel |
| Agentes Humanos | `HumanAgentsPage.tsx` | Human instance live status + agent type CRUD, migrated from operator-console HumanAgentPanel |

**New API functions in `src/api/registry.ts`:**
- `listChannels`, `createChannel`, `updateChannel`, `deleteChannel` → `/v1/channels`
- `listHumanInstances`, `instanceAction` → `/v1/instances?framework=human` / `PATCH /v1/instances/:id`
- `listHumanAgentTypes`, `createHumanAgentType`, `updateHumanAgentType`, `deleteAgentType` → `/v1/agent-types`
- `operatorHeaders()` — variant of `headers()` that includes `x-user-id: operator`

**Task #168 improvements (RegistryPanel migration):**
- `AgentTypesPage.tsx` — full rewrite: correct frameworks (plughub-native, human, external-mcp, langgraph, crewai, anthropic_sdk, azure_ai, google_vertex, generic_mcp), role select, max_concurrent_sessions, pool checkboxes, skills checkboxes, Deprecate→Confirm flow; pools rendered as chips in table
- `SkillsPage.tsx` — full rewrite: removed create form (skills are YAML-managed), info banner pointing to skill-flow-engine/skills/, detail modal shows tools/knowledge_domains chips
- `InstancesPage.tsx` — full rewrite: correct status filters (ready/busy/paused/draining), dynamic pool filter from API, channel_types column, 15s auto-refresh
- `PoolsPage.tsx` — added instagram/telegram/webrtc channel options
- Both i18n JSON files updated with new keys for executionModel, role, maxConcurrent, channels
- `types/index.ts` — fixed `AgentType.pools: Array<{pool_id: string}>`, `skills: Array<{skill_id; version_policy?}>`, added `updated_at?`
- `api/registry.ts` — `createAgentType` now maps `pools: string[]` → `{pool_id}[]` before POST

**New types in `src/types/index.ts`:**
`ChannelType`, `GatewayConfig`, `CreateGatewayConfigInput`, `UpdateGatewayConfigInput`,
`HumanAgentType`, `CreateHumanAgentInput`, `UpdateHumanAgentInput`, `AgentInstance`

Build: **486 kB JS / 143 kB gzip** (0 TypeScript errors).

### Migrated panels — billing module

`packages/platform-ui/src/modules/billing/BillingPage.tsx` — migrated from `packages/operator-console/src/components/PricingPanel.tsx`.

Route: `/config/billing` (role: `admin`). Nav entry: 💳 Faturamento under Configuração group.

**Components:**
- `ResourceSidebar` (220px left panel) — base + reserve resource list grouped by pool; admin token input
- `InvoiceTab` — base items table + reserve group blocks with activate/deactivate toggle; grand total; XLSX export link
- `ConsumptionTab` — usage dimensions from analytics-api with info banner (not included in billing)

**Inline hooks** (no separate hooks file needed):
- `useInvoice(tenantId)` → `GET /v1/pricing/invoice/{tenantId}`
- `useResources(tenantId)` → `GET /v1/pricing/resources/{tenantId}`
- `useUsage(tenantId)` → `GET /reports/usage?tenant_id={tenantId}`

**Vite proxy added** to `vite.config.ts`:
- `'^/v1/pricing'` → `http://localhost:3900` (before the generic `'^/v1'` → port 3300 entry)

**New types in `src/types/index.ts`:**
`InvoiceLineItem`, `ReserveGroup`, `Invoice`, `InstallationResource`

Build: **404 kB JS / 117 kB gzip** (0 TypeScript errors).

### Migrated panels — skill-flows module

`packages/platform-ui/src/modules/skill-flows/SkillFlowsPage.tsx` — migrated from `packages/operator-console/src/components/SkillFlowEditor.tsx`.

Route: `/skill-flows` (roles: `admin`, `developer`). Replaces the former `PlaceholderPage`.

**Features (fully ported):**
- Monaco YAML editor (`vs-dark` theme, `@monaco-editor/react`) with live YAML validation
- Left sidebar: skill list with search, type color-coding (orchestrator=violet, vertical=cyan, horizontal=yellow), modification indicator `●`
- New skill flow: prompts for skill_id, injects blank template with the entered id
- Save: YAML→JSON parse → `PUT /v1/skills/:id` — 422 validation errors shown in status bar
- Delete: three-stage confirmation (Delete → Confirmar → execute)
- Discard: reverts to last saved state
- ⌘S keyboard shortcut
- Auto-refresh skill list every 30s

**New dependencies added to `package.json`:** `@monaco-editor/react@^4.7.0`, `js-yaml@^4.1.1`, `@types/js-yaml@^4.0.9`

Build: **469 kB JS / 139 kB gzip** (0 TypeScript errors — Monaco adds ~65 kB gzipped).

### Migrated panels — campaigns module

`packages/platform-ui/src/modules/campaigns/CampaignsPage.tsx` — migrated from `packages/operator-console/src/components/CampaignPanel.tsx`.

Route: `/campaigns` (roles: `operator`, `supervisor`, `admin`, `business`). Accessible via Analytics → Campanhas nav entry.

**Features (fully ported):**
- Left 320px sidebar: global KPI bar (Campanhas / Total / Taxa), channel + status filter dropdowns, campaign card list with `MiniBar` (4-color status bar) and `RateBadge` (green/yellow/red)
- Right detail panel: campaign header with rate badge, 4-up KPI grid (Total / Respondidos / Expirados / Tempo médio), status distribution bar with legend, channel breakdown with progress bars, recent collect events table (token · canal · status · enviado · tempo)
- `useCampaignData` inline hook — polls `GET /reports/campaigns` every 30s, supports channel/status filters
- New types added to `src/types/index.ts`: `CampaignSummary`, `CollectEvent`
- i18n: `nav.campanhas` added to pt-BR and en locales

Build: **510 kB JS / 149 kB gzip** (0 TypeScript errors — Monaco included in bundle).

### Migrated panels — config-plataforma module (task #171)

`packages/platform-ui/src/modules/config-plataforma/components/NamespaceEditor.tsx` — upgraded to match full `ConfigPanel` feature set from operator-console.

Route: `/config/platform` (role: `admin`), tab ⚙️ Configuração. No new route needed — the ConfigPlataformaPage already existed.

**New features added to NamespaceEditor:**
- **Scope selector** in edit mode: 🌐 Global default vs 🏢 Tenant override — `putConfig(ns, key, value, null | tenantId, adminToken)`
- **"tenant override" badge** on entries where `entry.tenant_id ≠ '__global__'`
- **Reset button** (delete override) — restores global default; only shown when `adminToken` is set
- **Description display** per key (from `ConfigEntry.description`)
- **Tailwind redesign** — replaces inline CSS with design system tokens (`text-primary`, `bg-gray-50`, etc.)

**`config-hooks.ts` updated:**
- `ConfigEntry` extended with `tenant_id: string | null`, `namespace?: string`, `updated_at?: string`
- `useNamespace` return type changed from `Record<string, unknown>` → `Record<string, ConfigEntry>`
- Normalisation shim handles APIs that return plain values instead of `ConfigEntry` objects
- `AllConfig.config` type updated to `Record<string, Record<string, ConfigEntry>>`

**`MaskingPage.tsx` updated:** adapted to use `entries[key]?.value` instead of direct entry (due to type change).

Build: **513 kB JS / 150 kB gzip** (0 TypeScript errors).

### Legacy standalone apps — ✅ migração completa, pacotes removidos

- `packages/operator-console/` — ✅ **Removido** (diretório deletado; docker-compose atualizado). Todos os 12 painéis migrados para `platform-ui`:
  - ✅ ChannelPanel → `config-recursos/ChannelsPage.tsx`
  - ✅ HumanAgentPanel → `config-recursos/HumanAgentsPage.tsx`
  - ✅ PricingPanel → `modules/billing/BillingPage.tsx`
  - ✅ SkillFlowEditor → `modules/skill-flows/SkillFlowsPage.tsx`
  - ✅ RegistryPanel (Pools/AgentTypes/Skills/Instances) → `config-recursos/` tabs (task #168)
  - ✅ WorkflowPanel + WebhookPanel → `modules/workflows/WorkflowsPage.tsx` with tabs ⚡ Instâncias | 🔗 Webhooks (task #169)
  - ✅ CampaignPanel → `modules/campaigns/CampaignsPage.tsx` (task #170)
  - ✅ ConfigPanel → `modules/config-plataforma/components/NamespaceEditor.tsx` (task #171 — merged into existing ConfigPlataformaPage at `/config/platform`)
- `packages/agent-assist-ui/` (port 5175) — chat + right panel → ✅ migrated to `modules/agent-assist/AgentAssistPage.tsx` (task #172)

### What never to do

- Never create a new `packages/my-ui/` standalone app — add a module to platform-ui
- Never use inline hex colors — use Tailwind tokens (`text-primary`, `bg-secondary`)
- Never write custom CSS when a Tailwind class exists
- Never create a NavItem without `roles` filter

## Arc 7 — Autenticação Real, Permissões e Roteamento por Performance

### Arc 7a — auth-api (✅ implementado)

Usuários reais, JWT HS256, session lifecycle com refresh token rotation.
Substitui o modelo de `x-tenant-id`/`x-user-id` como headers livres.

**Pacote:** `packages/auth-api/` — Python FastAPI, porta 3200.

#### PostgreSQL schema (schema `auth`)

```sql
CREATE TABLE auth.users (
    id               UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    tenant_id        TEXT NOT NULL,
    email            TEXT NOT NULL,
    name             TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    password_hash    TEXT NOT NULL,   -- bcrypt rounds=12
    roles            TEXT[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    accessible_pools TEXT[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',  -- [] = todos os pools
    active           BOOL NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at, updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    UNIQUE (tenant_id, email)
);

CREATE TABLE auth.sessions (
    id                 UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id            UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    tenant_id          TEXT NOT NULL,
    refresh_token_hash TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,  -- SHA-256(plain_token)
    expires_at         TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    last_used_at       TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

#### JWT claims (access token — HS256, TTL 1h)

```json
{
  "sub":              "user-uuid",
  "tenant_id":        "tenant_demo",
  "email":            "user@example.com",
  "name":             "User Name",
  "roles":            ["operator", "supervisor"],
  "accessible_pools": ["retencao_humano", "sac"],
  "exp": ..., "iat": ...
}
```

`accessible_pools: []` significa acesso a todos os pools (usuário admin/developer).

#### Refresh token

Token opaco de 43 chars URL-safe (~258 bits de entropia). Armazenado como SHA-256 em `auth.sessions` — plain token nunca persisted. Rotation automática em cada `POST /auth/refresh` (novo par emitido, hash antigo substituído atomicamente).

#### Endpoints

| Método | Rota | Auth | Descrição |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/auth/login` | — | Login email+senha → access_token + refresh_token |
| `POST` | `/auth/refresh` | body refresh_token | Rotation → novo par |
| `POST` | `/auth/logout` | body refresh_token | Invalida refresh_token (idempotente) |
| `GET` | `/auth/me` | Bearer | Claims do access token |
| `GET` | `/auth/users` | X-Admin-Token | Lista usuários do tenant |
| `POST` | `/auth/users` | X-Admin-Token | Cria usuário |
| `GET` | `/auth/users/{id}` | X-Admin-Token | Detalhe do usuário |
| `PATCH` | `/auth/users/{id}` | X-Admin-Token | Atualiza usuário (name, password, roles, accessible_pools, active) |
| `DELETE` | `/auth/users/{id}` | X-Admin-Token | Remove usuário |
| `GET` | `/health` | — | Healthcheck |

#### Seed automático

Ao iniciar, `seed_admin_if_absent()` cria o usuário admin configurado via env vars se não existir. Idempotente — sem erro em re-inicializações.

#### Variáveis de ambiente (prefixo `PLUGHUB_AUTH_`)

| Var | Default | Descrição |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://plughub:plughub@postgres:5432/plughub` | DSN PostgreSQL |
| `JWT_SECRET` | `changeme_auth_jwt_secret_at_least_32_chars` | Segredo HS256 |
| `JWT_ALGORITHM` | `HS256` | Algoritmo JWT |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` | `60` | TTL do access token |
| `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS` | `7` | TTL do refresh token |
| `ADMIN_TOKEN` | `""` | Token admin (vazio = sem auth em dev) |
| `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` | `admin@plughub.local` | Email do admin seed |
| `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `changeme_admin` | Senha do admin seed |
| `SEED_TENANT_ID` | `tenant_demo` | Tenant do admin seed |

### Arc 7b — platform_permissions (✅ implementado)

Generaliza `evaluation_permissions` para todo o sistema. Implementado em `packages/auth-api/`.

#### PostgreSQL schema (schema `auth`)

```sql
-- Permissão explícita: uma linha por (user_id, module, action, scope_type, scope_id)
CREATE TABLE auth.platform_permissions (
    id          UUID        PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    tenant_id   TEXT        NOT NULL,
    user_id     TEXT        NOT NULL,
    module      TEXT        NOT NULL,   -- analytics | evaluation | billing | config | registry | skill_flows | campaigns | workflows | *
    action      TEXT        NOT NULL,   -- view | edit | admin | *
    scope_type  TEXT        NOT NULL CHECK (scope_type IN ('pool', 'global')),
    scope_id    TEXT,                   -- pool_id for scope_type='pool'; NULL for global
    granted_by  TEXT        NOT NULL DEFAULT 'system',
    template_id UUID,                   -- FK para permission_templates (auditoria)
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    UNIQUE (tenant_id, user_id, module, action, scope_type, COALESCE(scope_id, ''))
);

-- Template nomeado de permissões (conjunto reutilizável)
CREATE TABLE auth.permission_templates (
    id          UUID        PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    tenant_id   TEXT        NOT NULL,
    name        TEXT        NOT NULL,
    description TEXT        NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    permissions JSONB       NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]',   -- list[{module, action, scope_type, scope_id}]
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    UNIQUE (tenant_id, name)
);
```

#### Domínios válidos

| Campo | Valores |
|---|---|
| `module` | `analytics`, `evaluation`, `billing`, `config`, `registry`, `skill_flows`, `campaigns`, `workflows`, `*` |
| `action` | `view`, `edit`, `admin`, `*` |
| `scope_type` | `pool` (scope_id = pool_id), `global` (scope_id = NULL) |

Curingas: `module='*'` ou `action='*'` batem em qualquer valor pedido.

#### Endpoints (X-Admin-Token)

| Método | Rota | Descrição |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/auth/permissions` | Concede permissão (upsert idempotente) |
| `GET` | `/auth/permissions?tenant_id=&user_id=&module=` | Lista permissões com filtros |
| `DELETE` | `/auth/permissions/{id}` | Revoga permissão |
| `GET` | `/auth/permissions/resolve?tenant_id=&user_id=&module=&action=&pool_id=` | Resolve se usuário tem permissão (sem admin token) |
| `POST` | `/auth/templates` | Cria template |
| `GET` | `/auth/templates?tenant_id=` | Lista templates |
| `GET` | `/auth/templates/{id}` | Detalhe do template |
| `PATCH` | `/auth/templates/{id}` | Atualiza template |
| `DELETE` | `/auth/templates/{id}` | Remove template |
| `POST` | `/auth/templates/{id}/apply` | Materializa permissões do template para um usuário |

#### Funções principais (`permissions.py`)

```python
grant_permission(...)       → dict   # ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE (idempotente)
revoke_permission(...)      → bool
list_permissions(...)       → list[dict]   # filtros: tenant_id, user_id, module
resolve_permissions(...)    → bool   # global scope primeiro, depois pool scope
get_accessible_pools_for_module(...)  → list[str] | None
# None = acesso global (todos os pools); [] = sem acesso; [...] = pools específicos

apply_template(pool, template_id, tenant_id, user_id, granted_by, scope_override=None)
# Materializa template → platform_permissions (sem lookup em cadeia no runtime)
# scope_override: {"scope_type": "pool", "scope_id": "pool_sac"} para restringir ao bind
```

#### Resolução de permissão

```
resolve_permissions(tenant_id, user_id, module, action, pool_id=None):
  1. Busca linhas WHERE (module=$m OR module='*') AND (action=$a OR action='*')
  2. scope_type='global'                     → True
  3. scope_type='pool' AND scope_id=$pool_id → True (se pool_id fornecido)
  4. Nenhuma match                           → False
```

#### Arquivos

| Arquivo | Responsabilidade |
|---|---|
| `permissions.py` | DDL + CRUD: `ensure_permissions_schema`, grant/revoke/list/resolve, templates CRUD + apply |
| `router.py` | Endpoints de permissão e template adicionados ao router existente |
| `models.py` | `GrantPermissionRequest`, `PermissionResponse`, `PermissionEntry`, `CreateTemplateRequest`, `UpdateTemplateRequest`, `TemplateResponse`, `ApplyTemplateRequest`, `ResolvePermissionResponse` |

### Arc 7c — visibilidade por pool em analytics (✅ implementado)

JWT carrega `accessible_pools[]`. analytics-api injeta `WHERE pool_id IN (...)` nas queries ClickHouse. Row-level security sem subselects — whitelist de pool_ids vem diretamente do JWT.

#### Arquivos novos / modificados

| Arquivo | Alteração |
|---|---|
| `analytics-api/config.py` | Campo `auth_jwt_secret: str = ""` — segredo HS256 do auth-api (deve coincidir com `PLUGHUB_AUTH_JWT_SECRET`) |
| `analytics-api/pool_auth.py` | **NOVO** — `PoolPrincipal` + `optional_pool_principal` FastAPI dependency |
| `analytics-api/reports_query.py` | `_apply_pool_scope()` helper; parâmetro `accessible_pools: list[str] | None` em 6 funções: sessions, agents, quality, participation, segments, agent_performance |
| `analytics-api/reports.py` | `Depends(optional_pool_principal)` em 6 endpoints; `accessible_pools` propagado para query helpers |

#### PoolPrincipal — semântica de acessível

```python
accessible_pools = None    # acesso irrestrito — todos os pools
accessible_pools = [...]   # restrito a esses pool_ids (JWT com lista de pools)
```

#### optional_pool_principal — comportamento por cenário

| Cenário | Resultado |
|---|---|
| `analytics_open_access=True` OU `auth_jwt_secret=""` | `accessible_pools=None` (sem restrição) |
| Sem header Authorization | `accessible_pools=None` (backward-compatible) |
| JWT válido, `accessible_pools=[]` | `accessible_pools=None` (convenção auth-api: `[]` = todos os pools) |
| JWT válido, `accessible_pools=["sac","retencao"]` | `accessible_pools=["sac","retencao"]` |
| JWT inválido/expirado | HTTP 401 |

#### `_apply_pool_scope` — aplicado nas queries

Quando `accessible_pools` é uma lista não-vazia, injeta:
```sql
AND pool_id IN ('pool_sac', 'pool_retencao')
```
Quando `accessible_pools=[]` (lista vazia), o caller retorna `{"data": [], "meta": {total: 0}}` sem chamar o ClickHouse (short-circuit).

#### Env var

```
PLUGHUB_ANALYTICS_AUTH_JWT_SECRET=<mesmo valor que PLUGHUB_AUTH_JWT_SECRET>
```

Quando vazia (default), pool scoping é desabilitado (todos os pools visíveis).

#### Endpoints com pool scoping

`GET /reports/sessions`, `/reports/agents`, `/reports/quality`, `/reports/participation`, `/reports/segments`, `/reports/agents/performance`

Os endpoints que não têm dimensão `pool_id` (`/reports/usage`, `/reports/workflows`, `/reports/campaigns`, `/reports/evaluations`) não foram modificados.

#### Testes

`analytics-api/tests/test_reports.py` — 63/63 passando. Classes novas Arc 7c:
- `TestApplyPoolScope` (4) — helper puro: None noop, lista vazia retorna False, IN clause gerado corretamente
- `TestPoolScopedSessionsReport` (3) — None passa, vazia short-circuits, lista injeta IN clause no SQL
- `TestPoolScopedAgentsReport` (2) — idem para agent_events
- `TestPoolPrincipalAuth` (9) — open_access, sem secret, sem token, JWT []→None, JWT lista→restrito, JWT inválido→401

### Arc 7d — roteamento por performance (✅ implementado)

Batch job lê `mv_agent_performance_daily` (ClickHouse) e escreve scores normalizados em Redis.
`score_resource()` no routing-engine blenda competência com performance histórica com peso configurável.

#### Score formula

```
performance_score = resolution_rate × (1 − min(escalation_rate, 1.0))
```

Resultado em [0.0, 1.0]. Recompensa alta taxa de resolução, penaliza escalação.

#### Blending no score_resource()

```
final = (1 − w) × competency_score + w × performance_score

w = performance_score_weight (0.0–1.0)
  0.0 = puro competency (padrão — backward-compatible, sem Redis reads)
  0.3 = 70% competência + 30% performance histórica (recomendado em produção)
```

Hard filter (-1.0) é preservado independente do performance_score.
Quando sem dados (novo agent, primeiros 7 dias), `performance_score = 0.5` (neutro — sem viés).

#### Redis key pattern

```
{tenant_id}:agent_perf:{agent_type_id}
  Value: str(float) in [0.0, 1.0]
  TTL:   21600s (6h) — renovado a cada sync (5 min)
```

#### Configuração

```
PLUGHUB_PERFORMANCE_SCORE_WEIGHT=0.3    # env var no routing-engine
```

Ou via Config API namespace `routing` key `performance_score_weight` (editável por tenant no Operator Console).

#### Componentes implementados

| Arquivo | Responsabilidade |
|---|---|
| `analytics-api/performance_job.py` | `compute_performance_score()`, `run_performance_sync()`, `run_performance_job_loop()` — batch job query + Redis write |
| `analytics-api/main.py` | Inicializa `perf_task` background em lifespan; `POST /admin/performance-sync` para trigger manual |
| `routing-engine/registry.py` | `_agent_perf_key()` helper; `InstanceRegistry.get_agent_performance_score()` — lê Redis com fallback 0.5 |
| `routing-engine/scorer.py` | `score_resource()` estendida com `performance_score` + `performance_score_weight` params |
| `routing-engine/router.py` | `_allocate()` lê `perf_weight` de settings; busca score via `get_agent_performance_score()` quando weight > 0 |
| `routing-engine/config.py` | `performance_score_weight: float = 0.0` (env `PLUGHUB_PERFORMANCE_SCORE_WEIGHT`) |
| `config-api/seed.py` | Seed entry `routing.performance_score_weight = 0.0` com descrição |

#### Parâmetros do batch job

| Constante | Valor | Descrição |
|---|---|---|
| `PERF_KEY_TTL` | 21600s (6h) | TTL das chaves Redis de performance |
| `LOOKBACK_DAYS` | 7 | Janela de lookback no ClickHouse |
| `MIN_SESSIONS` | 5 | Mínimo de sessões para significância estatística |
| Intervalo do loop | 300s (5 min) | Frequência de sync performance → Redis |

#### Tests

- `analytics-api/tests/test_performance_job.py` — 12 assertions: `TestComputePerformanceScore` (6 — fórmula, edge cases), `TestRunPerformanceSync` (6 — Redis write, key format, TTL, CH error, Redis error)
- `routing-engine/tests/test_scorer.py`: `TestResourceScorerPerformanceBlending` (6 assertions — zero weight backward-compat, high perf boost, low perf penalty, hard filter preserved, neutral default no-bias, no-requirements pool blending)

### Platform-UI — integração real com auth-api (✅ implementado)

A platform-ui foi integrada ao auth-api real (porta 3200), substituindo o formulário mock por autenticação JWT completa.

#### Token storage strategy

| Token | Localização | Motivo |
|---|---|---|
| `access_token` | Memória (React state) | Não persiste entre reloads — re-obtido via refresh silencioso |
| `refresh_token` | `localStorage('plughub_refresh_token')` | Sobrevive reload — base para silent re-auth |
| Metadados (name, role, tenant) | `localStorage('plughub_session_meta')` | Persiste sem expor token |

#### Arquivos modificados/criados

| Arquivo | Descrição |
|---|---|
| `src/api/auth.ts` (NOVO) | `apiLogin`, `apiRefresh`, `apiLogout` — client HTTP para auth-api; `AuthApiError` com status HTTP |
| `src/auth/AuthContext.tsx` | Reescrito: JWT flow real, auto-refresh (60s antes da expiração), silent re-auth no mount |
| `src/auth/LoginPage.tsx` | Reescrito: email + password reais, tratamento de erros por status HTTP (401/403/5xx) |
| `src/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx` | Atualizado: spinner durante `isInitializing`; preserva URL de destino em `location.state` |
| `src/auth/useAuth.ts` | Inalterado (expõe novo `isInitializing` e `getAccessToken` via context) |
| `src/types/index.ts` | `Session` extendido com `email`, `roles[]`, `accessiblePools[]`, `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `expiresAt` |
| `src/shell/TopBar.tsx` | `handleLogout` tornou-se async; exibe `session.email` em vez de `session.userId` |
| `vite.config.ts` | Proxy `'^/auth'` → `http://localhost:3200` adicionado |

#### Fluxo de autenticação

```
Login:
  LoginPage → apiLogin(email, password) → TokenResponse
  → buildSession() → setState + localStorage + scheduleRefresh()

Auto-refresh:
  setTimeout (60s antes de expiresAt) → apiRefresh(refreshToken)
  → novo TokenResponse → re-agendamento

Silent re-auth no mount:
  localStorage tem refresh_token → apiRefresh()
    → sucesso: session restaurada, isInitializing=false
    → falha: clearStorage(), isInitializing=false (→ login page)

Logout:
  clearTimeout, setSession(null), clearStorage()
  → apiLogout(refreshToken, accessToken) — best-effort
```

#### `getAccessToken()` — para API clients

Método disponível em `useAuth()`:
```typescript
const token = await getAccessToken()   // null se não autenticado
// Verifica expiração, faz refresh se necessário, deduplica chamadas concorrentes
```

#### `isInitializing` — evita flash do login

`ProtectedRoute` mostra spinner enquanto `isInitializing=true`, evitando que usuários com refresh_token válido vejam o formulário de login por 100–500ms antes do redirect.

### Arc 3 — Analytics, Dashboard Operacional e Relatórios

**Dependência prévia:** ~~AI Gateway deve publicar `sentiment.updated` no Kafka antes da analytics-api poder agregar sentimento por pool em real-time.~~ ✅ Implementado: `sentiment_emitter.py` publica `sentiment.updated` no Kafka e mantém `{tenant_id}:pool:{pool_id}:sentiment_live` no Redis após cada turno LLM.

**Novos pacotes:**
- `packages/analytics-api/` — consumer Kafka→ClickHouse, API REST, SSE
- `packages/operator-console/` — React app: heatmap, drill-down, intervenção

**Tasks:**

1. ~~**AI Gateway — publicar sentiment.updated**~~: ✅ `sentiment_emitter.py` — `emit_sentiment_updated` (Kafka topic `sentiment.updated`) + `update_sentiment_live` (Redis hash `{tenant_id}:pool:{pool_id}:sentiment_live`, TTL 300s, avg_score + distribuição por categoria). Wired em `SessionManager.update_partial_params`. Tests: `test_sentiment_emitter.py` (41 assertions).

2. ~~**analytics-api — consumer + ClickHouse schema**~~: ✅ `packages/analytics-api/` — 6 tabelas ClickHouse (`sessions`, `queue_events`, `agent_events`, `messages`, `usage_events`, `sentiment_events`), todas `ReplacingMergeTree` para idempotência. Consumer multi-topic (8 tópicos) com commit manual após batch. Parsers por topic (models.py). ClickHouse + analytics-api adicionados ao docker-compose.test.yml. Tests: `test_consumer.py` (30 assertions).

3. ~~**analytics-api — endpoints dashboard**~~: ✅ `GET /dashboard/operational` (SSE, Redis snapshots, 5s interval, `event: pools`), `GET /dashboard/metrics` (ClickHouse últimas 24h — sessions/agent_events/usage/sentiment agregados, retorna 503 em erro), `GET /dashboard/sentiment` (Redis `sentiment_live` por pool). Query helpers em `query.py`: `get_metrics_24h` (4 queries CH, `asyncio.to_thread`), `get_pool_snapshots` (scan+mget), `get_sentiment_live` (scan+hgetall). Tests: `test_dashboard.py` (18 assertions).

4. ~~**analytics-api — endpoints reports + BI export**~~: ✅ `GET /reports/sessions`, `/reports/agents`, `/reports/quality`, `/reports/usage`. Filtros opcionais por endpoint (channel, outcome, close_reason, pool_id, agent_type_id, event_type, dimension, source_component, category). Paginação (`page`, `page_size`): max 1000 JSON / 10000 CSV. `format=csv` retorna `text/csv` com `Content-Disposition: attachment`. Helpers em `reports_query.py` (`asyncio.to_thread`, count + data query, `_to_csv`). Tests: `test_reports.py` (26 assertions).

5. ~~**analytics-api — camada admin consolidada**~~: ✅ `GET /admin/consolidated` com agregação cross-tenant por canal e por pool; RBAC: tenant operator vê apenas `tenant_id = X`, admin vê tudo. Auth Bearer JWT HS256 (`admin_jwt_secret`). `Principal.effective_tenant()` aplica o filtro correto por role. `admin_query.py`: 3 queries CH (`by_channel` com breakdown por outcome, `by_pool` sessions + sentinel overlay de `sentiment_events`). Tests: `test_admin.py` (21 assertions — `TestPrincipal`, `TestRequirePrincipal`, `TestQueryConsolidated`).

6. ~~**operator-console fase 1 — heatmap + métricas realtime**~~: ✅ heatmap de sentimento por pool (tiles coloridos por avg_score, ordered worst-first), painel lateral com métricas do pool (available/queue/SLA/distribuição) e resumo 24h; atualização via SSE ~5s. `packages/operator-console/` — React 18 + TypeScript + Vite. Hooks: `usePoolSnapshots` (SSE EventSource), `useSentimentLive` (poll 10s), `useMetrics24h` (poll 60s), `usePoolViews` (merge). Componentes: `HeatmapGrid`, `PoolTile` (cor interpolada, badge SLA breach), `MetricsPanel` (pool detail + distribution bars + 24h summary), `Header` (tenant input, status dot). Build: `tsc -b && vite build` → 157 kB JS gzip 50 kB.

7. ~~**operator-console fase 2 — drill-down read-only**~~: ✅ pool → lista de sessões ativas → transcrição ao vivo. Backend: `sessions.py` em `analytics-api` — `GET /sessions/active` (ClickHouse `closed_at IS NULL` + Redis pipeline LRANGE sentiment, sorted worst-first), `GET /sessions/{id}/stream` (SSE: evento `history` com XRANGE + eventos `entry` via XREAD bloqueante, keepalive 15s), e `GET /sessions/customer/{customer_id}` (histórico de contatos fechados por cliente, `ORDER BY opened_at DESC`, com `FINAL` para dedup ReplacingMergeTree). ClickHouse `sessions` table acrescida de coluna `customer_id Nullable(String)` + migration idempotente `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`. Consumer/models: `parse_inbound` e `parse_conversations_event` passam `contact_id`/`customer_id` do evento Kafka. Frontend: `useActiveSessions` (poll 10s), `useSessionStream` (EventSource SSE), `SessionList`, `SessionTranscript`, `HeatmapGrid`/`PoolTile` drill-down. `App.tsx` refatorado para 3 níveis: heatmap → sessions → transcript. Build: 168 kB JS gzip 53 kB. Tests: `test_sessions.py` (54 assertions — TestClassify, TestSafeJson, TestParseEntry, TestFetchActiveSessions, TestOverlaySentiment, TestListActiveSessionsEndpoint, TestFetchCustomerHistory, TestCustomerHistoryEndpoint). Total analytics-api: 149/149.

8. ~~**operator-console fase 3 — intervenção ativa**~~: ✅ Supervisores humanos entram em sessões ativas diretamente via REST (bypass do ciclo MCP agent_login). Backend: `packages/analytics-api/src/plughub_analytics_api/supervisor.py` — `POST /supervisor/join` (cria `supervisor:{session_id}:active` no Redis TTL 4h, XADD `participant_joined` agents_only), `POST /supervisor/message` (XADD `message` no formato `StreamSubscriber._map_event()`, visibility `agents_only` ou `all`), `POST /supervisor/leave` (XADD `participant_left`, DELETE Redis key, idempotente). Router wired em `main.py`. Frontend: `SupervisorPanel.tsx` (composer com visibility toggle, Enter=send, Shift+Enter=newline, Leave button), `SupervisorJoinButton` (inline no header), `useSupervisor` hook (`join/message/leave` com estado `idle|joining|active|leaving|error`), `SupervisorState` type. `SessionTranscript.tsx` atualizado: botão "Entrar como supervisor" no header → `SupervisorPanel` na base quando ativo. Build: 173 kB JS gzip 54 kB.

9. ~~**Metabase setup**~~: ✅ `docker-compose.infra.yml` — serviços `metabase-driver-init` (baixa driver ClickHouse v1.3.2), `metabase` (v0.50.0, porta 3000, persiste em PostgreSQL), `metabase-setup` (one-shot via API Metabase). `infra/metabase/clickhouse_users.sql` — usuários CH read-only por tenant + Row Policies em 6 tabelas (sandboxing por `tenant_id` via conexão isolada). `infra/metabase/setup.py` — inicialização automatizada: admin account, conexões ClickHouse por tenant, 5 questions base (Sessões por Canal, Queue Events, Agent Performance, Usage Metering, Sentiment Timeline), dashboard "PlugHub Analytics" com grid de 5 cards. Acesso: http://localhost:3000 · admin@plughub.local.

10. ~~**Config Management Module — separação env vars × configuração de módulo**~~: ✅ `packages/config-api/` com tabela PostgreSQL `platform_config (tenant_id, namespace, key, value JSONB, updated_at)` + API REST CRUD (`GET/PUT/DELETE /config/{namespace}/{key}`) + seed de todos os valores atuais hardcoded. Leitura com cache Redis (TTL 60s) para não adicionar latência no hot path. ~~Fase 2: UI de visualização no operator-console~~ ✅ `ConfigPanel.tsx` — sidebar de namespaces, tabela de keys com valores resolvidos, EditDrawer com JSON editor inline, scope toggle (global vs tenant), admin token local.
    - **Dois níveis**: `tenant_id = '__global__'` para defaults de plataforma; tenant real para overrides específicos. Lookup: tenant wins over global.
    - **8 namespaces seedados**: `sentiment` (thresholds, live_ttl_s), `routing` (snapshot_ttl_s, sla_default_ms, score_weights, estimated_wait_factor, congestion_sla_factor), `session` (ai_gateway_ttl_s, channel_gateway_ttl_s), `consumer` (batch_size, timeout_ms, restart_delay_s, max_restart_delay_s), `dashboard` (sse_interval_s, sse_retry_ms), `webchat` (auth_timeout_s, attachment_expiry_days, upload_limits_mb), `masking` (authorized_roles, default_retention_days, capture_input_default, capture_output_default), `quota` (max_concurrent_sessions, llm_tokens_daily, messages_daily).
    - **`ConfigStore`**: `get()` (cache hit → DB miss), `get_or_default()`, `list_namespace()` (com cache de namespace), `list_all()`, `set()` (upsert + invalidação imediata), `delete()`. Invalidação global faz SCAN para limpar variantes de tenant.
    - **`config.changed` (Kafka)**: Config API publica no tópico `config.changed` após cada PUT/DELETE bem-sucedido. Payload: `{event, tenant_id, namespace, key, operation, updated_at}`. Consumidores roteiam por namespace:
      | Namespace | Consumidor | Reação |
      |---|---|---|
      | `quota` | orchestrator-bridge | `bootstrap.request_refresh()` — reconcilia instâncias |
      | `routing` | routing-engine (futuro) | invalida cache local de SLA/scoring |
      | `masking`, `session`, `webchat`, `sentiment`, `consumer`, `dashboard` | (cache Redis 60s) | sem ação imediata; propagação natural via TTL |
    - Tests: `test_store.py` (27 assertions — TestConfigCache, TestConfigStoreGet, TestConfigStoreSet, TestConfigStoreDelete, TestConfigStoreList, TestSeedData).

**Arquitetura de dados:**
```
Kafka topics → analytics-api consumer → ClickHouse
  (conversations.*, agent.done, usage.events, queue.position_updated, sentiment.updated)

Redis snapshots + sentiment_live → analytics-api → SSE → operator-console
PostgreSQL (evaluation, sentiment_timeline) → analytics-api (queries pontuais)

ClickHouse → Metabase (relatórios self-service)
analytics-api REST → BI externos (PowerBI, Looker, Tableau)
```

### Arc 5 — ContactSegment (✅ implementado — v1)

Base analítica para SLA por agente, avaliação granular e relatórios de participação com duração real.
ADR: `docs/adr/adr-contact-segments.md`.

**ContactSegment** é a entidade que representa uma janela de participação contígua de um agente numa sessão.
Cada segmento tem `segment_id` próprio, `sequence_index` para handoffs sequenciais, e `parent_segment_id`
para a topologia de conferência (specialist aponta para o primary segment).

#### Schemas — `@plughub/schemas/src/contact-segment.ts`

```typescript
ContactSegmentSchema {
  segment_id:        UUID
  session_id, tenant_id, participant_id, pool_id, agent_type_id, instance_id
  role:              "primary" | "specialist" | "supervisor" | "evaluator" | "reviewer"
  agent_type:        "ai" | "human"
  parent_segment_id: UUID | null      // null para primary; specialist aponta para primary
  sequence_index:    number           // 0 para primeiro primary; 1+ para handoffs sequenciais
  started_at, ended_at, duration_ms
  outcome:           "resolved" | "escalated" | "transferred" | "abandoned" | "timeout" | null
  close_reason, handoff_reason, issue_status
}

ConversationParticipantEventSchema {
  event_type:        "participant.joined" | "participant.left"
  segment_id:        UUID    // obrigatório — gerado no orchestrator-bridge
  sequence_index, parent_segment_id
  ...demais campos existentes...
}
```

#### orchestrator-bridge — geração de segment_id

`_publish_participant_event` estendida com os parâmetros: `segment_id`, `sequence_index`, `parent_segment_id`, `outcome`, `close_reason`, `handoff_reason`, `issue_status`.

| Evento | Redis key | Lógica |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| `activate_human_agent` | `session:{id}:segment:{instance_id}` (TTL 4h) + `session:{id}:primary_segment` + INCR `session:{id}:segment_seq` | Gera `_seg_id`, armazena, publica `participant_joined` com `sequence_index` |
| `process_routed` (native joined) | `session:{id}:segment:{native_instance_id}` (TTL 4h) | Lê `primary_segment` para conferência (→ `parent_segment_id`), armazena novo `_part_seg_id` |
| `process_routed` (native left) | GETDEL `session:{id}:segment:{instance_id}` | Recupera o mesmo UUID usado no joined; passa `outcome` do `agent_result` |
| `process_contact_event` (human left) | GETDEL `session:{id}:segment:{instance_id}` | Mesmo padrão |

#### analytics-api — tabelas ClickHouse

| Tabela | Engine | Descrição |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| `analytics.segments` | `ReplacingMergeTree(ingested_at)` ORDER BY `(tenant_id, session_id, segment_id)` | Uma linha por participação; `participant_left` win sobre `participant_joined` no merge |
| `analytics.session_timeline` | `ReplacingMergeTree(ingested_at)` ORDER BY `(tenant_id, session_id, timestamp, event_id)` | Série temporal de eventos enriquecidos com `segment_id` |

#### analytics-api — `models.py`

`parse_participant_event` retorna `list[dict]` em vez de `dict` — dois rows por evento:
- `participation_row` → tabela `participation_intervals` (legado, compatibilidade Arc 3 Fase C)
- `segment_row` → tabela `segments` (Arc 5); inclui `segment_id`, `parent_segment_id`, `sequence_index`, `outcome`, `close_reason`, `handoff_reason`, `issue_status`

#### analytics-api — endpoints

| Endpoint | Filtros | Descrição |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| `GET /reports/segments` | `session_id`, `pool_id`, `agent_type_id`, `role`, `outcome`, `from_dt`, `to_dt`, `page`, `page_size`, `format` | Linhas de `segments FINAL` (ReplacingMergeTree dedup); `format=csv` disponível |
| `GET /reports/agents/performance` | `pool_id`, `agent_type_id`, `role`, `from_dt`, `to_dt`, `format` | Métricas agregadas por `(agent_type_id, pool_id, role)`: `total_sessions`, `avg_duration_ms`, `escalation_rate`, `handoff_rate`, breakdowns por outcome; sem paginação |

#### Arquivos modificados / criados

| Arquivo | Alteração |
|---------|-----------|
| `packages/schemas/src/contact-segment.ts` | CRIADO — `SegmentOutcomeSchema`, `ContactSegmentSchema`, `ConversationParticipantEventSchema` |
| `packages/schemas/src/index.ts` | Exporta os novos schemas de contact-segment |
| `packages/orchestrator-bridge/src/plughub_orchestrator_bridge/main.py` | `_publish_participant_event` + Redis keys de segment tracking em `activate_human_agent`, `process_routed`, `process_contact_event` |
| `packages/analytics-api/src/plughub_analytics_api/clickhouse.py` | `_DDL_SEGMENTS`, `_DDL_SESSION_TIMELINE`, `upsert_segment()`, `insert_timeline_event()` |
| `packages/analytics-api/src/plughub_analytics_api/models.py` | `parse_participant_event` → `list[dict]`; segment_row completo |
| `packages/analytics-api/src/plughub_analytics_api/consumer.py` | Dispatch `segments` → `upsert_segment`; `session_timeline` → `insert_timeline_event` |
| `packages/analytics-api/src/plughub_analytics_api/reports_query.py` | `query_segments_report` + `_fetch_segments`; `query_agent_performance_report` + `_fetch_agent_performance` |
| `packages/analytics-api/src/plughub_analytics_api/reports.py` | `GET /reports/segments` endpoint; `GET /reports/agents/performance` endpoint |
| `packages/analytics-api/.../tests/test_consumer.py` | `TestParseParticipantEvent` (8 assertions); `test_segments_dispatched`, `test_session_timeline_dispatched` |
| `packages/analytics-api/.../tests/test_reports.py` | `TestQuerySegmentsReport` (3 assertions); `TestQueryAgentPerformanceReport` (5 assertions) |
| `packages/e2e-tests/scenarios/23_contact_segments.ts` | CRIADO — Parts A/B/C (11 assertions) |
| `packages/e2e-tests/runner.ts` | `--segments` flag + import `scenario23` |

**Pendente (v2):**
- Enrichment post-hoc de `segment_id` em eventos sem o campo (sentimento, mcp.audit)
- Materialized views `segment_summary` e `agent_performance`

### AI Gateway — Multi-account rotation, workload isolation, fallback chain (✅ implementado)

Suporte a múltiplas chaves de API Anthropic + OpenAI como fallback, com isolamento de workloads por `model_profile` e rotação automática sob throttling.

#### AccountSelector — Redis-backed load balancing

Implementado em `packages/ai-gateway/src/plughub_ai_gateway/account_selector.py`.

**Princípio:** stateless a cada chamada. Nenhum estado em memória — todas as decisões baseadas em Redis.

```
AccountSelector.pick(provider):
  1. Para cada conta registrada do provider:
     a. Verifica throttle key (MGET ai_gw:{provider}:{key_id}:throttled) — exclui se presente
     b. Calcula score: (rpm_used/rpm_limit × rpm_weight) + (tpm_used/tpm_limit × tpm_weight)
  2. Retorna provider_key da conta com menor score
  3. None → sem contas disponíveis → fallback cross-provider
```

**Redis keys:**

| Key | TTL | Conteúdo |
|---|---|---|
| `ai_gw:{provider}:{key_id}:throttled` | `throttle_retry_after_s` (Config API) | `"1"` — conta excluída da rotação |
| `ai_gw:{provider}:{key_id}:rpm` | 60 s (rolling) | Contador de requests no minuto atual |
| `ai_gw:{provider}:{key_id}:tpm` | 60 s (rolling) | Contador de tokens no minuto atual |

**`key_id`** = SHA-256(api_key)[:16] — nunca persiste o valor bruto da chave.

**Scoring:** `score = (rpm_used/rpm_limit × 0.7) + (tpm_used/tpm_limit × 0.3)`. Pesos configuráveis via Config API namespace `ai_gateway` (`utilization_rpm_weight`).

#### Configuração multi-chave

```bash
# Uma chave (backward compatible)
PLUGHUB_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Múltiplas chaves (vírgula separado — AccountSelector ativado)
PLUGHUB_ANTHROPIC_API_KEYS=sk-ant-...,sk-ant-...,sk-ant-...

# OpenAI como fallback (opcional — requer pacote openai>=1.0.0)
PLUGHUB_OPENAI_API_KEYS=sk-...
```

`Settings.get_anthropic_keys()` / `get_openai_keys()` normalizam ambos os formatos.

#### Registro de providers em main.py

```python
# Anthropic: um provider por chave + alias "anthropic" → primeira chave (backward compat /v1/turn, /v1/reason)
for api_key in anthropic_keys:
    acc = LLMAccount(provider="anthropic", api_key=api_key, rpm_limit=..., tpm_limit=...)
    providers[acc.provider_key] = AnthropicProvider(api_key=api_key)   # "anthropic:{key_id}"
    accounts.append(acc)
providers["anthropic"] = providers[accounts[0].provider_key]            # alias primeira chave

# OpenAI: idem, opcional
for api_key in openai_keys:
    acc = LLMAccount(provider="openai", api_key=api_key, ...)
    providers[acc.provider_key] = OpenAIProvider(api_key=api_key)       # "openai:{key_id}"
    accounts.append(acc)
```

`AccountSelector(redis, accounts)` criado se `accounts` não-vazio; `None` em dev sem chaves.

#### _call_with_fallback — cadeia completa

```
InferenceEngine._call_with_fallback(profile, messages, tools):

  1. AccountSelector.pick(profile.provider)
       → provider_key (e.g. "anthropic:abc123")
       → None → vai direto ao fallback cross-provider

  2. provider.call(messages, tools, model_id, max_tokens)
       ✓ success → record_usage(provider_key, tokens) → return
       ✗ retryable (rate_limit / status_429 / status_529):
           → mark_throttled(provider_key, ttl=throttle_retry_after_s)
           → AccountSelector.pick(provider) novamente (próxima conta)
               → retry → sucesso ou exaustão
       ✗ não-retryable → raise ProviderError

  3. Sem contas disponíveis (todas throttled) OU sem AccountSelector:
       profile.fallback presente?
           Sim → FallbackConfig(provider, model_id)
                 → providers[fallback.provider].call(model_id=fallback.model_id, ...)
                 → return (provider_used=fallback.provider)
           Não → raise ProviderError(retryable=False)
```

#### Isolamento de workloads por model_profile

| Profile | Model | Fallback | Uso |
|---|---|---|---|
| `realtime` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | `gpt-4o` (se OpenAI configurado) | Agentes em atendimento ao vivo |
| `balanced` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | `gpt-4o-mini` | Fluxos de baixa latência |
| `evaluation` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | `model_balanced` | Avaliação batch — isolado de tráfego realtime |

O profile `evaluation` garante que workloads de avaliação não compitam com agentes em sessão.
`evaluation_model` e `evaluation_max_tokens` são configuráveis via Config API namespace `ai_gateway`.

#### OpenAIProvider

`packages/ai-gateway/src/plughub_ai_gateway/providers/openai_provider.py`

- Degrada graciosamente se pacote `openai` ausente (levanta `ProviderError(error_code="sdk_not_installed")`)
- Converte formato de tools Anthropic (`input_schema`) para OpenAI (`function.parameters`)
- Role mapping: `customer→user`, `agent→assistant`, `system→system` (system vai como `role: system`, diferente do Anthropic que usa campo `system=`)
- Stop reason: `tool_calls→tool_use`, `length→max_tokens`, else `end_turn`

#### Config API — namespace ai_gateway

| Key | Default | Descrição |
|---|---|---|
| `account_rotation_enabled` | `true` | Habilita AccountSelector; `false` = sempre usa primeira chave |
| `throttle_retry_after_s` | `60` | TTL de exclusão após 429/529 |
| `utilization_rpm_weight` | `0.7` | Peso RPM no score (TPM = 1 - rpm_weight) |
| `evaluation_model` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Modelo do profile `evaluation` |
| `evaluation_max_tokens` | `2048` | Max tokens para inferência de avaliação |
| `openai_fallback_enabled` | `false` | Documenta se fallback OpenAI está ativo (operacional) |

### evaluation-api (porta 3400)

#### Forms CRUD

| Método | Rota | Descrição |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/v1/evaluation/forms?tenant_id=` | Lista formulários ativos |
| `POST` | `/v1/evaluation/forms` | Cria formulário |
| `PATCH` | `/v1/evaluation/forms/{form_id}` | Atualiza formulário |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/evaluation/forms/{form_id}` | Remove formulário |

#### Campaigns CRUD + controle

| Método | Rota | Descrição |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/v1/evaluation/campaigns?tenant_id=` | Lista campanhas |
| `POST` | `/v1/evaluation/campaigns` | Cria campanha |
| `POST` | `/v1/evaluation/campaigns/{id}/pause` | Pausa campanha |
| `POST` | `/v1/evaluation/campaigns/{id}/resume` | Retoma campanha |

#### Instances lifecycle

| Método | Rota | Descrição |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/v1/evaluation/instances?campaign_id=&status=` | Lista instâncias por campanha |

Instâncias são criadas automaticamente pelo **sampling engine** ao consumir eventos `conversations.session_closed`. O engine avalia `SamplingRules` e cria a instância se a sessão for selecionada.

#### Results

| Método | Rota | Descrição |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/v1/evaluation/results?tenant_id=&campaign_id=&evaluator_id=` | Lista resultados |
| `GET` | `/v1/evaluation/results/{id}?caller_user_id=` | Detalhe com `available_actions` computado server-side |
| `POST` | `/v1/evaluation/results/{result_id}/review` | Revisor humano age (requer JWT + permissão de review no pool/campanha) |

Body de review: `{ decision: "approved" | "rejected", round: number, review_note? }`. O campo `round` é anti-replay — deve ser igual a `result.current_round` ou o servidor retorna `409`.

#### Contestations

| Método | Rota | Descrição |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/v1/evaluation/contestations?tenant_id=&result_id=` | Lista contestações |
| `POST` | `/v1/evaluation/contestations` | Cria contestação (requer JWT + permissão de contest no pool/campanha) |
| `POST` | `/v1/evaluation/contestations/{id}/adjudicate` | Adjudica contestação — mantido para compatibilidade (fluxo legado sem workflow) |

Body de contestation: `{ result_id, reason, round: number }`. O campo `round` é anti-replay — deve ser igual a `result.current_round`.

#### Reports

| Método | Rota | Descrição |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/v1/evaluation/reports/campaigns/{id}` | Relatório por campanha |
| `GET` | `/v1/evaluation/reports/agents?tenant_id=&pool_id=` | Relatório por agente |

#### Auth

- **Operações admin** (CRUD de formulários, campanhas, permissões): `X-Admin-Token` header
- **Operações de revisão e contestação**: `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` com claims `sub` (user_id) e `roles[]`
  - O evaluation-api extrai `caller.user_id` do `sub` do JWT para registrar `reviewed_by` / `contested_by`
  - Permissões são verificadas contra `evaluation_permissions` (tabela PostgreSQL) antes de executar a ação

#### Permissions CRUD

| Método | Rota | Descrição |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/v1/evaluation/permissions?tenant_id=&user_id=` | Lista permissões do usuário |
| `POST` | `/v1/evaluation/permissions` | Concede permissão (admin) |
| `PATCH` | `/v1/evaluation/permissions/{id}` | Atualiza permissão (admin) |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/evaluation/permissions/{id}` | Revoga permissão (admin) |

### mcp-server-knowledge

MCP Server separado para a base de conhecimento vetorial dos agentes avaliadores.

**PostgreSQL schema (pgvector):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE knowledge_snippets (
    snippet_id   UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    tenant_id    TEXT NOT NULL,
    namespace    TEXT NOT NULL,           -- ex: "politicas_sac", "sla_contrato"
    content      TEXT NOT NULL,
    embedding    vector(1536),            -- OpenAI text-embedding-3-small
    source_ref   TEXT,                   -- documento de origem
    metadata     JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at   TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
CREATE INDEX ON knowledge_snippets USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
CREATE INDEX ON knowledge_snippets (tenant_id, namespace);
```

**Tools expostos:**
| Tool | Descrição |
|---|---|
| `knowledge_search` | Busca semântica top-K no namespace, retorna `KnowledgeSnippet[]` |
| `knowledge_upsert` | Insere/atualiza snippet com embedding automático |
| `knowledge_delete` | Remove snippet por snippet_id |

**API REST (proxied via Vite `/v1/knowledge`):**
| Método | Rota | Descrição |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/v1/knowledge/search?tenant_id=&query=&namespace=&top_k=` | Busca semântica |
| `POST` | `/v1/knowledge/snippets` | Upsert snippet |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/knowledge/snippets/{id}` | Remove snippet |

### Agents

#### agente_avaliacao_v1 — form-aware + RAG + evidência

`packages/skill-flow-engine/skills/agente_avaliacao_v1.yaml`

Fluxo:
```
carregar_contexto (invoke: evaluation_context_get)
  → ReplayContext: stream events, form definition, campaign_context, knowledge_snippets (top-5)

avaliar_criterios (reason LLM):
  - Para cada critério do formulário:
    - Analisa transcrição → score / pass_fail / N/A
    - Extrai evidence (trecho textual)
    - Computa overall_score ponderado
  - Incorpora knowledge_snippets como contexto normativo
  - Detecta compliance_flags (sla_breached, escalation_required, protocol_violation)

submeter_resultado (invoke: evaluation_submit):
  - criterion_responses[] com evidence por critério
  - overall_score, compliance_flags
  - eval_status: "submitted"
```

**Fallback:** se agent-registry retorna HTTP 422 (YAML sem `complete`/`escalate`), `_load_yaml_fallback()` no orchestrator-bridge lê o arquivo YAML diretamente.

#### agente_reviewer_ia_v1 — auto-aprovação/rejeição

`packages/skill-flow-engine/skills/agente_reviewer_ia_v1.yaml`

Fluxo:
```
carregar_resultado (invoke: evaluation_context_get)
  → EvaluationResult + critérios + threshold rules

decisao_automatica (choice):
  overall_score >= reviewer_rules.auto_approve_above → aprovar
  overall_score <  reviewer_rules.auto_reject_below  → rejeitar
  reviewer_rules.require_human_review eq true        → fila_humana
  default                                            → fila_humana

aprovar (invoke: evaluation_submit):
  eval_status: "approved", review_note: "Auto-aprovado por score ≥ threshold"

rejeitar (invoke: evaluation_submit):
  eval_status: "rejected", review_note: "Auto-rejeitado por score < threshold"

fila_humana (notify agents_only):
  Sinaliza ao supervisor para revisão manual
```

### Modelo de Permissão 2D — usuário × (pool | campanha)

Eixo de permissão independente do papel do usuário no sistema: um mesmo usuário pode ter permissão de contestar num pool e de revisar em outro, e ter ambas em uma campanha específica.

#### PostgreSQL schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE evaluation_permissions (
    id          UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    tenant_id   TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id     TEXT NOT NULL,
    scope_type  TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (scope_type IN ('pool', 'campaign', 'global')),
    scope_id    TEXT,           -- pool_id ou campaign_id; NULL para global
    can_contest BOOL NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    can_review  BOOL NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    granted_by  TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
    UNIQUE (tenant_id, user_id, scope_type, scope_id)
);
```

#### Resolução de permissão (herança de escopo)

Resolução do mais específico para o mais geral. Permissões são acumulativas (union), não se excluem:

```
campaign-level  >  pool-level  >  global
```

Exemplo: usuário X com `can_review=true` no pool A e `can_contest=true` na campanha C (que usa o pool A) → X pode revisar via herança do pool, e contestar via herança da campanha. Ambas as permissões são válidas.

```python
async def resolve_permissions(tenant_id, user_id, campaign_id, pool_id) -> set[str]:
    rows = await db.fetch("""
        SELECT can_contest, can_review FROM evaluation_permissions
        WHERE tenant_id = $1 AND user_id = $2
          AND (
            (scope_type = 'campaign' AND scope_id = $3)
            OR (scope_type = 'pool'     AND scope_id = $4)
            OR (scope_type = 'global')
          )
    """, tenant_id, user_id, campaign_id, pool_id)

    permissions = set()
    for row in rows:
        if row["can_contest"]: permissions.add("contest")
        if row["can_review"]:  permissions.add("review")
    return permissions
```

#### `available_actions` — campo computado server-side

O endpoint `GET /v1/evaluation/results/{id}?caller_user_id=` devolve `available_actions` já calculado, combinando o estado do workflow (`action_required` + `locked`) com as permissões do usuário. A UI nunca computa permissão localmente — apenas lê o campo:

```
available_actions = []
if not locked and action_required == "review"       and "review"  in perms → ["review"]
if not locked and action_required == "contestation" and "contest" in perms → ["contest"]
```

| `action_required` | Permissão do caller | `available_actions` | Botões na UI |
|---|---|---|---|
| `"review"` | `can_review=true` | `["review"]` | Revisar ✓ / Contestar ✗ |
| `"review"` | `can_contest=true` | `[]` | Revisar ✗ / Contestar ✗ |
| `"contestation"` | `can_contest=true` | `["contest"]` | Revisar ✗ / Contestar ✓ |
| `null` (outra parte age) | qualquer | `[]` | Ambos desabilitados + mensagem "Aguardando {authority}" |
| `null` + `locked=true` | qualquer | `[]` | Badge "Encerrado" |

**Defesa em profundidade**: a UI desabilita botões com base em `available_actions`, mas o endpoint de submit repete a verificação de permissão no servidor. O servidor nunca confia no estado calculado pelo cliente.

---

### Workflow como Motor de Contestação/Revisão

O ciclo de revisão/contestação é executado pelo Workflow API (Arc 4) como motor de estado. O YAML da skill define quantos rounds existem, timeouts e alçadas — sem lógica hardcoded no evaluation-api. Mudar o ciclo de um cliente = atualizar um YAML via `PUT /v1/skills/{id}`.

#### Ligação campanha → workflow skill

```
EvaluationCampaign.review_workflow_skill_id = "skill_revisao_simples_v1"
                                             | "skill_revisao_treplica_v1"
                                             | qualquer skill configurada pelo cliente
```

#### Ciclo de vida completo

```
1. EvaluationResult submetido
   → evaluation-api: POST /v1/workflow/trigger
     { flow_id: campaign.review_workflow_skill_id,
       origin_session_id: result.session_id,
       context: { result_id, campaign_id, tenant_id } }
   → workflow entra no primeiro suspend (aguardar_revisao)
   → workflow.events consumer atualiza o result:
       action_required = "review", current_round = 1, deadline_at, resume_token

2. Usuário age na UI — endpoint ecoa o round recebido (anti-replay)
   POST /v1/evaluation/results/{id}/review   { decision, round: 1 }
   POST /v1/evaluation/contestations         { result_id, round: 1, reason }
   → evaluation-api verifica permissão (resolve_permissions)
   → verifica anti-replay: round_body == result.current_round ou rejeita 409
   → grava no banco (audit trail)
   → escreve no ContextStore:
       session.review_decision  = "approved" | "contested"
       session.reviewer_id      = caller.user_id
       session.round_echoed     = 1
   → POST /v1/workflow/resume { token: result.resume_token, decision: "input" }

3. Workflow lê @ctx.session.review_decision no choice step → transita
   → próximo suspend: escreve current_round incrementado no ContextStore
   → workflow.events consumer atualiza action_required, current_round, deadline_at, resume_token

4. Timeout: suspend expira sem retomada
   → workflow entra em on_timeout → congelar_resultado step
   → evaluation-api consumer: locked=true, lock_reason="review_timeout", action_required=null
   → qualquer chamada subsequente sobre o result_id retorna 409 Conflict — result locked
```

#### Padrão do round counter — controlado pelo workflow, ecoado pela UI

O workflow escreve `@ctx.session.current_round` ao entrar em cada suspend. A UI lê o valor recebido no result e o devolve no submit. O evaluation-api usa esse valor para o anti-replay check. O YAML é o único lugar com lógica de quantas voltas existem.

```yaml
# Fragmento — o workflow incrementa o próprio contador
- id: incrementar_round
  type: invoke
  tool: context_write
  input:
    tag: session.current_round
    value: "{{add(@ctx.session.current_round, 1)}}"
  on_success: verificar_limite

- id: verificar_limite
  type: choice
  conditions:
    - field: "@ctx.session.review_decision"
      operator: eq
      value: "approved"
      next: encerrar_aprovado
    - field: "@ctx.session.current_round"
      operator: gt
      value: 3              # tréplica: único lugar onde o limite existe
      next: congelar_resultado
    - field: "@ctx.session.review_decision"
      operator: eq
      value: "contested"
      next: aguardar_contestacao
```

Clientes com réplica configuram `value: 2`; tréplica, `value: 3` — sem nenhuma alteração de código.

#### ContextStore keys usadas pelo motor de avaliação

| Tag | Valor | Escrito por |
|---|---|---|
| `session.current_round` | `number` | Workflow (ao entrar no suspend) |
| `session.action_required` | `"review" \| "contestation"` | Workflow (ao entrar no suspend) |
| `session.review_decision` | `"approved" \| "contested"` | evaluation-api (antes do resume) |
| `session.reviewer_id` | `user_id` | evaluation-api (antes do resume) |
| `session.round_echoed` | `number` | evaluation-api (confirmação do anti-replay) |

TTL: os campos de workflow de avaliação usam TTL de 7 dias (`604800s`) — diferente do TTL padrão de 4h do ContextStore — para suportar ciclos de revisão longos. Configurável via Config API namespace `evaluation` key `workflow_context_ttl_s`.

#### consumer `workflow.events` no evaluation-api

```python
async def on_workflow_event(event):
    result_id = event.get("context", {}).get("result_id")
    if not result_id:
        return

    if event["event_type"] == "workflow.suspended":
        step = event.get("suspended_at_step", "")
        action = "review" if "revisao" in step else "contestation" if "contestacao" in step else None
        await db.update_result_workflow_state(result_id,
            action_required  = action,
            current_round    = event["context"].get("current_round", 1),
            deadline_at      = event.get("resume_expires_at"),
            resume_token     = event.get("resume_token"),
        )

    elif event["event_type"] == "workflow.completed":
        lock_reason = event.get("context", {}).get("lock_reason", "completed")
        await db.update_result_workflow_state(result_id,
            action_required = None,
            resume_token    = None,
            locked          = True,
            lock_reason     = lock_reason,
        )
```

### session-replayer — extensões Arc 6

O `ReplayContext` foi estendido com campos de avaliação:

```python
@dataclass
class ReplayContext:
    # ... campos existentes ...
    evaluation_form:     dict | None     # formulário associado pela campanha
    campaign_context:    dict | None     # metadados da campanha (sampling, reviewer_rules)
    knowledge_snippets:  list[dict]      # top-K snippets do namespace do formulário
```

O Replayer busca `evaluation_form` e `campaign_context` via evaluation-api ao construir o `ReplayContext` quando `evaluation_instance_id` está presente no evento `evaluation.requested`.

### MCP tools — extensões Arc 6

#### evaluation_context_get (estendido)

Retorna `ReplayContext` enriquecido com `evaluation_form`, `campaign_context` e `knowledge_snippets`. O agente avaliador vê os critérios do formulário e os snippets de conhecimento relevantes num único call.

#### evaluation_submit (estendido)

```typescript
// Input Arc 6 (estendido)
{
  result_id?:           string      // novo resultado ou update de rascunho
  instance_id:          string
  session_id:           string
  form_id:              string
  campaign_id?:         string
  criterion_responses:  EvaluationCriterionResponse[]
  overall_score:        number
  eval_status:          string
  compliance_flags?:    string[]
  review_note?:         string
  reviewed_by?:         string
  // Comparison Mode (Arc 3 — mantido)
  comparison_turns?:    ComparisonTurn[]
  comparison_replay_outcome?:   string
  comparison_replay_sentiment?: number
}
```

### analytics-api — ClickHouse Arc 6

#### Tabelas

```sql
-- Estado atual de cada resultado (ReplacingMergeTree — latest eval_status wins)
CREATE TABLE analytics.evaluation_results (
    result_id        String,

) ENGINE = MergeTree()
  ORDER BY (tenant_id, result_id, timestamp);
```

#### Kafka consumer

Tópico `evaluation.events` adicionado a `_TOPICS` e `_PARSERS` em `consumer.py`.

`parse_evaluation_event(msg)` retorna dois rows por evento:
- `{"table": "evaluation_results", ...}` — estado atual do resultado (upsert)
- `{"table": "evaluation_events", ...}` — entrada do log de auditoria

`_write_row` despacha via `store.upsert_evaluation_result()` e `store.insert_evaluation_event()`.

#### Endpoints analytics

| Endpoint | Filtros | Descrição |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /reports/evaluations` | `tenant_id`, `from_dt`, `to_dt`, `campaign_id`, `form_id`, `evaluator_id`, `eval_status`, `page`, `page_size`, `format` | Linhas individuais de `evaluation_results FINAL` |
| `GET /reports/evaluations/summary` | `tenant_id`, `from_dt`, `to_dt`, `campaign_id`, `form_id`, `group_by` | Agregação por `campaign_id` / `evaluator_id` / `form_id` / `date` |

**Campos do sumário:** `total_evaluated`, `count_submitted`, `count_approved`, `count_rejected`, `count_contested`, `count_locked`, `count_locked_flag`, `avg_score`, `min_score`, `max_score`, `score_excellent (≥0.9)`, `score_good (0.7–0.9)`, `score_fair (0.5–0.7)`, `score_poor (<0.5)`, `with_compliance_flags`.

**Proteção SQL injection:** `group_by` validado contra whitelist `{"campaign_id", "evaluator_id", "form_id", "date"}` antes de injetar na cláusula GROUP BY. Valores inválidos retornam ao default `campaign_id`.

### Kafka topics

### Tests

- `analytics-api/tests/test_consumer.py`: `TestParseEvaluationEvent` (14 assertions), `TestWriteRowDispatchEvaluation` (2 assertions)
- `analytics-api/tests/test_reports.py`: `TestQueryEvaluationsReport` (4 assertions), `TestQueryEvaluationsSummary` (4 assertions)
- Total analytics-api: **108/108**

### Arc 6 — Tests

- `e2e-tests/scenarios/24_evaluation_campaign.ts` — 14 assertions (--evaluation flag)
- `e2e-tests/scenarios/25_evaluation_contestation.ts` — 10 assertions (--contestation flag)
- `e2e-tests/scenarios/26_ai_gateway_fallback.ts` — 10 assertions (--fallback flag; inference parts require ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)

### Arc 6 v2 — ✅ Implementado (Permissões 2D + Workflow Motor)

Todos os componentes abaixo foram implementados:

- ✅ `evaluation_permissions` table + migration + endpoints `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /v1/evaluation/permissions`
  - `evaluation-api/db.py`: `create_permission`, `list_permissions`, `get_permission`, `update_permission`, `delete_permission`, `resolve_permissions`
  - UNIQUE index: `COALESCE(scope_id, '')` para suportar NULL em scope global sem violar constraint
- ✅ `EvaluationCampaign`: campos `review_workflow_skill_id` + `contestation_policy` (DDL + schema update em `db.py`)
- ✅ `EvaluationResult`: campos `workflow_instance_id`, `resume_token`, `action_required`, `current_round`, `deadline_at`, `lock_reason` (DDL em `db.py`)
- ✅ `EvaluationContestation`: campos `round_number`, `authority_level` (DDL em `db.py`)
- ✅ `GET /v1/evaluation/results/{id}?caller_user_id=` — `available_actions` computado server-side via `_compute_available_actions`
- ✅ `POST /v1/evaluation/results/{id}/review` — JWT decode (`_decode_jwt`), `resolve_permissions()`, anti-replay de `round`, ContextStore write, workflow resume
- ✅ `POST /v1/evaluation/contestations` — JWT decode, `resolve_permissions()`, anti-replay de `round`, ContextStore write (`session.review_decision = "contested"`), workflow resume
- ✅ Consumer `workflow.events` no `evaluation-api/main.py` — `_on_workflow_event()`: atualiza `action_required`, `current_round`, `deadline_at`, `resume_token`, `locked`, `lock_reason` via `update_result_workflow_state()` e `lock_result()`
- ✅ Trigger de workflow ao submeter resultado: `POST /v1/workflow/trigger` com `flow_id = campaign.review_workflow_skill_id`
- ✅ `packages/skill-flow-engine/skills/skill_revisao_simples_v1.yaml` — ciclo simples (1 round, 6 steps)
- ✅ `packages/skill-flow-engine/skills/skill_revisao_treplica_v1.yaml` — tréplica (até 3 rounds, 10 steps); alterar `value: 3` para `value: 2` para réplica
- ✅ MCP tool `evaluation_lock` em `mcp-server-plughub/src/tools/evaluation.ts` — idempotente: 409 = já locked (tratado como sucesso)
- ✅ ContextStore TTL 7 dias: Config API namespace `evaluation` key `workflow_context_ttl_s = 604800` + 4 keys adicionais (`default_review_skill_id`, `review_deadline_hours`, `contestation_deadline_hours`, `auto_lock_on_workflow_complete`)
- ✅ platform-ui: `EvaluationPermissionsPage.tsx` — gestão de permissões 2D por usuário/pool/campanha; rota `/evaluation/permissions` (role: admin); nav item 🔐 Permissões
- ✅ E2E scenarios 27/28: `27_evaluation_permissions.ts` (11 assertions, `--permissions`) + `28_evaluation_workflow_cycle.ts` (11 assertions, `--workflow-review`)

### Arc 6 v2 — Tests

- `e2e-tests/scenarios/27_evaluation_permissions.ts` — 11 assertions (--permissions flag): grant campaign/pool/global, list, update, resolve via available_actions, UNIQUE idempotency, revoke
- `e2e-tests/scenarios/28_evaluation_workflow_cycle.ts` — 11 assertions (--workflow-review flag; requires JWT_SECRET + workflow-api): submit → trigger → suspended → anti-replay 409 → review → ContextStore → workflow.completed → locked

**Invariantes desta arquitetura (nunca violar):**
- Nunca computar `available_actions` no cliente — sempre vem do servidor
- Nunca pular a verificação de `round` no submit — `round_body != result.current_round` → 409
- Nunca escrever `resume_token` em logs — é um segredo de retomada do workflow
- Nunca modificar resultado com `locked=true` — qualquer tentativa retorna 409
- Nunca fazer `workflow/resume` sem antes gravar `session.review_decision` no ContextStore — o choice step do workflow depende desse valor
- O YAML da skill é o único lugar com lógica de quantos rounds existem — nunca hardcodar `max_rounds` no evaluation-api

## Arc 4 — Workflow Automation

Permite que agentes nativos sejam usados como automação de processos com etapas manuais (aprovação, input, webhook, timer), sem BPM formal.

### Novos pacotes

- `packages/calendar-api/` — Python FastAPI, porta 3700. Engine puro de calendário.
- `packages/workflow-api/` — Python FastAPI, porta 3800. Ciclo de vida de WorkflowInstance.

### Novos schemas em `@plughub/schemas`

| Schema | Arquivo | Descrição |
|---|---|---|
| `SuspendStep` | `skill.ts` | Novo step type no FlowStepSchema |
| `WorkflowInstance` | `workflow.ts` | Registro persistido em PostgreSQL |
| `WorkflowTrigger`, `WorkflowResume` | `workflow.ts` | Requests de entrada |
| `WorkflowEvent` | `workflow.ts` | 7 eventos Kafka (started/suspended/resumed/completed/timed_out/failed/cancelled) |
| `HolidaySet`, `Calendar`, `CalendarAssociation` | `calendar.ts` | Hierarquia de calendários |
| `InstallationContext`, `ResourceScope` | `platform.ts` | Contexto de instalação |

### Calendar API — engine puro (no I/O)

| Função | Descrição |
|---|---|
| `is_open(associations, holidays, at)` | Verifica se uma entidade está aberta num instante |
| `next_open_slot(associations, holidays, after)` | Próxima janela aberta |
| `add_business_duration(associations, holidays, from_dt, hours)` | Deadline em horas úteis |
| `business_duration(associations, holidays, from_dt, to_dt)` | Horas úteis entre dois instantes |

Resolução de prioridade: exceptions > holidays > weekly_schedule.
Operadores: UNION (OR) + INTERSECTION (AND) por entidade.
Tests: `test_engine.py` — 25 assertions.

### Skill Flow `suspend` step

```typescript
// Flow definition
{ type: "suspend", id: "aguardar_aprovacao",
  reason: "approval",       // approval | input | webhook | timer
  timeout_hours: 48,
  business_hours: true,     // uses calendar-api for deadline
  on_resume:  { next: "processar" },
  on_timeout: { next: "escalar" },
  on_reject:  { next: "notificar_rejeicao" },
  notify: { visibility: "agents_only", text: "Token: {{resume_token}}" }
}
```

Mecanismo de idempotência (dois estágios): sentinel `"suspending"` → `"suspended"` em pipeline_state.results. Crash entre os dois stages resulta em re-suspend seguro na retomada.

`SkillFlowEngineConfig.persistSuspend` — callback opcional injetado pelo workflow-api worker. Quando ausente, deadline é wall-clock.
`engine.run({ resumeContext: { decision, step_id, payload } })` — sinal de retomada passa direto para o suspend step.

Tests: `suspend.test.ts` — 13 assertions.

### @mention — mention_commands handler (skill-flow-engine)

`packages/skill-flow-engine/src/mention-commands.ts` — pure async handler for specialist agent @mention commands.

| Export | Description |
|---|---|
| `parseCommandName(args_raw)` | Extracts first whitespace-delimited token from args_raw; `null` for bare mention |
| `handleMentionCommand(skill, commandName, ctx)` | Dispatches command: `set_context` → ContextStore write (fire-and-forget, non-fatal), `trigger_step` → returns `trigger_step` field for caller, `terminate_self` → returns flag for caller |

`MentionCommandResult`: `{ handled, acknowledge, trigger_step?, terminate_self }` — caller is responsible for Redis LPUSH and agent_done; this function does no I/O besides ContextStore writes.

Unknown commands return `{ handled: false }` — silently ignored per spec.

Tests: `mention-commands.test.ts` — 15 assertions (parseCommandName ×5, handleMentionCommand ×10: unknown, set_context ack/no-ack, multiple fields, no contextStore, ContextStore throws, trigger_step, terminate_self, empty mention_commands).

### Masked Input — begin_transaction / end_transaction step tests

`packages/skill-flow-engine/src/__tests__/steps/transaction.test.ts` — 9 unit tests for `executeBeginTransaction` and `executeEndTransaction`:
- `begin_transaction` clears maskedScope, sets `transactionOnFailure`, returns `__transaction_begin__`
- `end_transaction` clears maskedScope + transactionOnFailure, uses `__transaction_end__` or explicit `on_success`
- `result_as` persists `{ status: "ok", fields_collected: [...] }` — field names only, never values

`packages/skill-flow-engine/src/__tests__/engine-transaction.test.ts` — 5 engine integration tests:
- Happy path: `begin_transaction` → `menu(masked)` → `invoke(@masked.*)` → `end_transaction(result_as)` → `complete`; masked value passed to invoke, `tx_result` persisted without sensitive content
- Failure: invoke fails inside block → engine rewinds to `begin_transaction.on_failure`, maskedScope cleared
- Menu timeout inside block → rewind to `on_failure`

Total skill-flow-engine: **86/86 tests** (10 test files).

### agent-registry — masked block validation

`packages/agent-registry/src/validators/skill.ts` — `validateMaskedBlock(flow: SkillFlow): string[]`

Position-based BFS: for each `begin_transaction` at array position N, seeds BFS from `steps[N+1]` (matching engine's positional advance via `__transaction_begin__`). Visits success edges only (`on_success`, `choice.conditions[].next`, `choice.default`, `suspend.on_resume.next`, `collect.on_response.next`). Stops at `end_transaction`. Reports error for any `reason` step found inside the block.

HTTP 422 returned by both POST and PUT `/v1/skills` routes:
```json
{ "error": "invalid_masked_block", "details": ["Step \"bad_reason\" (reason) is inside masked transaction block..."] }
```

Tests: `packages/agent-registry/src/__tests__/skill-validator.test.ts` — 14 unit tests covering: no begin_transaction, empty steps, clean block, reason before/after block, reason directly inside, reason via on_success chain, reason via choice branch/default, on_failure exit (not visited), multiple blocks, last-step begin_transaction (no crash), end_transaction stops propagation.

### Workflow API — ciclo de vida

Tabela PostgreSQL `workflow.instances` (schema `workflow`).

| Endpoint | Chamado por | O que faz |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /v1/workflow/trigger` | Sistema externo / operator | Cria WorkflowInstance, emite `workflow.started` |
| `POST /v1/workflow/instances/{id}/persist-suspend` | Skill Flow worker (TS) | Calcula deadline (calendar-api ou wall-clock), persiste suspensão, emite `workflow.suspended` |
| `POST /v1/workflow/resume` | Sistema externo / aprovador | Valida token, verifica expiração, registra decisão, emite `workflow.resumed` |
| `POST /v1/workflow/instances/{id}/complete` | Skill Flow worker | Marca completed, emite `workflow.completed` |
| `POST /v1/workflow/instances/{id}/fail` | Skill Flow worker | Marca failed, emite `workflow.failed` |
| `POST /v1/workflow/instances/{id}/cancel` | Operator Console | Cancela active/suspended, emite `workflow.cancelled` |
| `GET /v1/workflow/instances` | Operator Console | Lista com filtros (tenant_id, status, flow_id) |
| `GET /v1/workflow/instances/{id}` | Operator Console | Detalhe |

**Timeout scanner** — asyncio background task (intervalo configurável, padrão 60s). `UPDATE ... SET status='timed_out' WHERE status='suspended' AND resume_expires_at < now()` — atômico, sem double-processing.

Tests: `test_router.py` — 48 assertions (TestTrigger, TestPersistSuspend, TestResume, TestComplete, TestFail, TestCancel, TestList, TestDetail, TestHealth, TestTimeoutScanner, TestWebhookCRUD, TestWebhookTrigger, TestWebhookDeliveries).

### Webhook Trigger — authenticated public endpoints

Permite que sistemas externos (Salesforce, ERP, etc.) disparem workflows via URL pública autenticada por token, substituindo o trigger manual do operador.

#### Token format

```
plughub_wh_<url-safe-43-chars>    (~258 bits de entropia)
```

Armazenamento: **SHA-256 hex digest** em `workflow.webhooks.token_hash` — plain token nunca é persistido.
`token_prefix` (16 primeiros chars) é armazenado para exibição no admin UI.
Comparação: `hmac.compare_digest` para proteção contra timing attacks.

#### PostgreSQL schema

```sql
-- Webhooks registrados (um por flow/tenant)
CREATE TABLE workflow.webhooks (
    id                UUID        PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    tenant_id         TEXT        NOT NULL,
    flow_id           TEXT        NOT NULL,
    description       TEXT        NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    token_hash        TEXT        NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    token_prefix      TEXT        NOT NULL,
    active            BOOL        NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
    trigger_count     BIGINT      NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    last_triggered_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    context_override  JSONB       NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at        TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at        TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- Log append-only de disparos (auditoria)
CREATE TABLE workflow.webhook_deliveries (
    id           UUID        PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    webhook_id   UUID        NOT NULL REFERENCES workflow.webhooks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    tenant_id    TEXT        NOT NULL,
    triggered_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    status_code  INT         NOT NULL,
    payload_hash TEXT        NOT NULL,
    instance_id  UUID,
    error        TEXT,
    latency_ms   INT
);
```

#### Endpoints

| Método | Rota | Auth | Descrição |
|--------|------|------|-----------|
| `POST`   | `/v1/workflow/webhooks`                         | `X-Admin-Token` | Cria webhook; retorna plain token (exibido uma vez) |
| `GET`    | `/v1/workflow/webhooks`                         | `X-Admin-Token` | Lista webhooks do tenant (filtros: `active`, `limit`, `offset`) |
| `GET`    | `/v1/workflow/webhooks/{id}`                    | `X-Admin-Token` | Detalhe do webhook |
| `PATCH`  | `/v1/workflow/webhooks/{id}`                    | `X-Admin-Token` | Atualiza `description`, `active`, `context_override` |
| `POST`   | `/v1/workflow/webhooks/{id}/rotate`             | `X-Admin-Token` | Rotaciona token (invalida o anterior; retorna novo plain token) |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/workflow/webhooks/{id}`                    | `X-Admin-Token` | Remove webhook e cascade-deletes deliveries |
| `GET`    | `/v1/workflow/webhooks/{id}/deliveries`         | `X-Admin-Token` | Últimos N registros de entrega (padrão 50, máx 200) |
| `POST`   | `/v1/workflow/webhook/{id}`                     | `X-Webhook-Token` (plain) | **Público** — dispara workflow |

#### Trigger flow (POST /v1/workflow/webhook/{id})

```
1. Lê raw body → SHA-256 payload_hash
2. Autentica: SHA-256(X-Webhook-Token) → lookup DB por token_hash
3. verify_token(plain, stored_hash) — constant-time guard extra
4. Verifica active; se inativo → db_record_delivery(403) + 403
5. Merge: context = {**webhook.context_override, **body_json}
6. db_create_instance + emit_started (mesmo que trigger manual)
7. db_record_delivery(202, instance_id, latency_ms)
8. trigger_count++, last_triggered_at = now() (atômico, 2xx only)
9. Retorna 202 { instance_id, flow_id, webhook_id, status: "accepted" }
```

### Operator Console — WebhookPanel

`packages/operator-console/src/components/WebhookPanel.tsx` — gestão completa de webhook triggers:

- **Sidebar esquerda**: lista de webhooks com nome, flow_id, status ativo/inativo e contagem de triggers; campo de admin token local; botão "New Webhook" abre formulário de criação.
- **Formulário de criação**: flow_id, description, context_override (JSON textarea com validação inline) — chama `POST /v1/workflow/webhooks`, exibe plain token UMA vez via `CopyBox` com dismiss obrigatório.
- **Detalhe de webhook**: grid de metadados (flow_id, description, token_prefix, trigger_count, last_triggered_at); URL pública copiável; ações — ativar/desativar, rotate token (exige confirmação), delete (exige confirmação).
- **Delivery log**: tabela das últimas 20 entregas com timestamp, status HTTP (colorido por faixa), latency_ms, instance_id e error message.
- **CopyBox**: componente de exibição one-time do plain token com botão copy-to-clipboard e botão "I've saved it" para dismiss — implementa o requisito de segurança de exibição única.

Hooks: `packages/operator-console/src/api/webhook-hooks.ts` — `useWebhooks` (poll 15s), `useWebhookDeliveries` (poll on mount), `createWebhook`, `patchWebhook`, `rotateWebhookToken`, `deleteWebhook`. Todos usam `VITE_WORKFLOW_API_BASE_URL ?? ''` — proxied pelo Vite via `/v1/workflow` → `http://localhost:3800`.

Nav: botão "Webhooks" (indigo — `#6366f1`/`#1e1b4b`) adicionado ao `Header.tsx`.

Build: 234 kB JS / 67 kB gzip.

### Operator Console — RegistryPanel

`packages/operator-console/src/components/RegistryPanel.tsx` — gestão de recursos do Agent Registry com quatro tabs:

- **Pools**: lista de pools com status, channels e SLA; formulário de criação (pool_id, channel_types, sla_target_ms, description); edição inline de SLA, channels e descrição.
- **Agent Types**: lista com framework, role e pools vinculados; formulário de criação (agent_type_id, framework, execution_model, role, max_concurrent_sessions, pools, skills, prompt_id); soft-delete (→ deprecated).
- **Skills**: lista read-mostly com tipo de classificação e versão; detail view com tools, domains, description; delete com confirmação. Skills são gerenciadas por YAML — o painel exibe o estado atual do banco.
- **Running**: lista read-only de instâncias ativas filtráveis por pool_id; atualização automática a cada 15s.

Hooks: `packages/operator-console/src/api/registry-hooks.ts` — `usePools`, `createPool`, `updatePool`, `useAgentTypes`, `createAgentType`, `deleteAgentType`, `useSkills`, `deleteSkill`, `useInstances`. Todos usam `x-tenant-id` + `x-user-id: operator` headers.

Proxy Vite: `/v1/pools`, `/v1/agent-types`, `/v1/skills`, `/v1/instances` → `http://localhost:3300`.

Nav: botão "Registry" (orange — `#f97316`/`#431407`) adicionado ao `Header.tsx`.

Build: 260 kB JS / 72 kB gzip.

### Operator Console — SkillFlowEditor

`packages/operator-console/src/components/SkillFlowEditor.tsx` — Monaco-based YAML editor para skills:

- **Left sidebar**: lista de skills com busca por skill_id/name; tipo de classificação e versão; botão "+ New Skill" abre prompt de criação com ID.
- **Editor principal**: Monaco com `defaultLanguage="yaml"`, `theme="vs-dark"`, `wordWrap`, `bracketPairColorization`. Validação YAML live em tempo real (parse errors mostrados na status bar).
- **Conversão JSON↔YAML**: skills são armazenadas como JSON na API e exibidas como YAML para legibilidade. `js-yaml.dump()` ao carregar; `js-yaml.load()` ao salvar.
- **Status bar**: mostra estado (`loading`, `saving`, `saved`, `error`, `parse_error`) com cor por estado.
- **Ações**: ⌘S / botão Save (`PUT /v1/skills/:id`), Discard (reverte ao estado salvo), Delete (com confirmação), modificado indicado por `●` no header.
- **Blank template**: novo skill inicia com YAML de exemplo completo (skill_id, name, version, description, classification, comentários para flow).

Hooks adicionados a `registry-hooks.ts`: `fetchSkill(tenantId, skillId)` (GET), `upsertSkill(tenantId, skillId, body)` (PUT).

Nav: botão "Skills" (violet — `#a78bfa`/`#2e1065`) adicionado ao `Header.tsx`.

Deps adicionadas ao `package.json`: `@monaco-editor/react@^4.7.0`, `js-yaml@^4.1.1`, `@types/js-yaml@^4.0.9`.

Build: 325 kB JS / 94 kB gzip.

### Operator Console — ChannelPanel

`packages/operator-console/src/components/ChannelPanel.tsx` — channel credential management for all supported channel types:

- **Left sidebar**: grouped by channel type (WhatsApp, Webchat, Voice, Email, SMS, Instagram, Telegram, WebRTC) with emoji icon, config count badge, and per-channel "+ Add" button.
- **CreateForm**: channel-aware form with per-channel `fields` (sensitive credentials rendered as `<input type="password">`) and `settingFields` (non-sensitive settings in 2-column grid). Toggle for active status.
- **ConfigDetail**: shows current masked values (`••••••`) for each credential field alongside new-value inputs; only fields with non-empty new values are included in PUT payload. Settings are editable in-place. `●` indicator for unsaved changes. Three-stage delete: Delete → Confirm → execute.
- **Accent**: teal (`#14b8a6` / `#042f2e`).
- **ToggleSwitch**: inline active/inactive toggle used in both create and detail forms.

Channel-specific credential templates:

| Channel | Credential fields | Setting fields |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| WhatsApp | access_token, phone_number_id, waba_id, webhook_verify_token | api_version, webhook_path |
| Webchat | jwt_secret | ws_auth_timeout_s, attachment_expiry_days, serving_base_url, cors_origins |
| Voice | api_key, api_secret, account_sid | inbound_number, provider, region |
| Email | smtp_password, api_key | smtp_host, smtp_port, from_address, from_name, provider |
| SMS | api_key, api_secret | sender_id, provider |

| Telegram | bot_token | webhook_path, bot_username |
| WebRTC | turn_secret | stun_url, turn_url, turn_username |

Backend: `packages/agent-registry/src/routes/channels.ts` — CRUD for `gateway_configs` table. `_maskCredentials()` replaces all credential values with `••••••` before returning. Triggers `registry.changed` on create/update/delete.

**Backend model:**
```prisma
model GatewayConfig {
  id           String   @id @default(uuid())
  tenant_id    String
  channel      String   // whatsapp | webchat | voice | email | sms | instagram | telegram | webrtc
  display_name String
  active       Boolean  @default(true)
  credentials  Json     @default("{}")   // masked on API read
  settings     Json     @default("{}")
  created_at   DateTime @default(now())
  updated_at   DateTime @updatedAt
  created_by   String   @default("operator")
  @@index([tenant_id])
  @@index([tenant_id, channel])
  @@map("gateway_configs")
}
```

Migration: `packages/agent-registry/prisma/migrations/20260427000000_add_gateway_configs/migration.sql`

Type shim: `packages/agent-registry/src/types/gateway-config.ts` — `GatewayConfigDelegate` interface used until `prisma generate` can run in a network-connected environment.

Hooks: `packages/operator-console/src/api/channel-hooks.ts` — `useChannels`, `createChannel`, `updateChannel`, `deleteChannel`. Proxied via Vite `/v1/channels` → `http://localhost:3300`.

Nav: botão "Channels" (teal — `#14b8a6`/`#042f2e`) adicionado ao `Header.tsx`.

Build: 345 kB JS / 97 kB gzip (estimated).

### Operator Console — HumanAgentPanel

`packages/operator-console/src/components/HumanAgentPanel.tsx` — human agent lifecycle management with two tabs:

- **Live Status tab** (`LiveTab`): table of all running human agent instances (`framework=human`), polling every 10 s. Status filter bar (All / Ready / Busy / Paused). `StatusBadge` renders colored pill per status. `ActionButtons` shows contextual actions:
  - Ready → Pause
  - Busy → Pause, Force Logout
  - Paused → Resume, Force Logout
  - PATCH `/v1/instances/:id` with `{ action: pause | resume | force_logout }`.
- **Profiles tab** (`ProfilesTab`): sidebar (280 px) listing active and deprecated `AgentType` records filtered client-side for `framework === 'human'`. Selecting a profile opens `ProfileDetail`; "+ New Profile" opens `CreateProfileForm`.
  - `CreateProfileForm`: `agent_type_id`, `role` select (primary/specialist/supervisor), `max_concurrent_sessions`, pool chip multi-select via comma-delimited input, permissions textarea. POSTs to `/v1/agent-types` with `framework: 'human'`, `execution_model: 'stateful'`.
  - `ProfileDetail`: read-only pool chips, editable `max_concurrent_sessions` and `permissions`. PUT via `/v1/agent-types/:id`. Three-stage Deprecate flow (Deprecate → Confirm → DELETE).
- **Accent**: emerald (`#10b981` / `#022c22`).

Backend changes (instances.ts):
- Added optional `framework` query param to `GET /v1/instances` — filters via nested `agent_type: { framework }` Prisma relation.
- Added `GET /v1/instances/:instance_id` detail endpoint (full `agent_type` join including pools).
- Added `PATCH /v1/instances/:instance_id` endpoint for operator actions; maps `pause → paused`, `resume → ready`, `force_logout → logout`; publishes `registry.changed`.

Hooks: `packages/operator-console/src/api/human-agent-hooks.ts` — `useHumanInstances` (poll 10 s), `instanceAction`, `useHumanAgentTypes`, `createHumanAgent`, `updateHumanAgent`, `deprecateHumanAgent`. Reuses existing Vite proxies `/v1/instances` and `/v1/agent-types` → `http://localhost:3300`.

Nav: botão "Agents" (emerald — `#10b981`/`#022c22`) adicionado ao `Header.tsx`.

Build: 360 kB JS / 101 kB gzip (estimated).

### Status transitions

### Kafka topic: workflow.events

Publicado pelo workflow-api em todos os status transitions. Consumido pelo Skill Flow worker para disparar `engine.run()` com `resumeContext`.

### Implementado neste módulo

- Operator Console — painel de instâncias Workflow (WorkflowPanel.tsx): status filter, timeline, resume token, cancel action
- Operator Console — WebhookPanel (WebhookPanel.tsx): CRUD de webhooks, delivery log, one-time token display, activate/deactivate/rotate/delete
- Operator Console — RegistryPanel (RegistryPanel.tsx): Pools / Agent Types / Skills / Running instances CRUD via agent-registry REST
- Operator Console — SkillFlowEditor (SkillFlowEditor.tsx): Monaco YAML editor for SkillFlow definitions, live validation, JSON↔YAML conversion
- Operator Console — ChannelPanel (ChannelPanel.tsx): channel credential management for WhatsApp, Webchat, Voice, Email, SMS, Instagram, Telegram, WebRTC; credentials masked on read

- agent-registry — `GET /v1/instances?framework=human`, `GET /v1/instances/:id` detail, `PATCH /v1/instances/:id` operator actions (pause/resume/force_logout)
- Vite proxy configuration para `/v1/workflow` routes

### Collect Step — async multi-channel data collection

Novo step type `collect` no Skill Flow. Permite que um workflow entre em contato com um alvo (customer/agent/external) via qualquer canal, apresenta uma interação estruturada, e suspende até receber resposta ou expirar o prazo.

```typescript
// Flow definition
{ type: "collect", id: "coletar_cpf",
  target:        { type: "customer", id: "{{customer_id}}" },
  channel:       "whatsapp",
  interaction:   "form",
  prompt:        "Por favor informe seu CPF",
  fields:        [{ id: "cpf", label: "CPF", type: "text" }],
  delay_hours:   0,            // envio imediato (ou scheduled_at para horário absoluto)
  timeout_hours: 24,
  business_hours: true,
  campaign_id:   "camp_cobranca_jan",
  output_as:     "cpf_response",
  on_response:   { next: "processar_cpf" },
  on_timeout:    { next: "escalar_sem_resposta" },
}
```

#### Timing

| Parâmetro | Descrição |
|---|---|
| `scheduled_at` | ISO-8601 absoluto — quando contatar o alvo |
| `delay_hours` | Relativo: agora + N horas |
| (nenhum) | Envio imediato |
| `timeout_hours` | Quanto esperar pela resposta após o envio (business-hours-aware) |

#### Correlação via collect_token

O Skill Flow gera um UUID (`collect_token`) e o workflow-api o persiste no `collect_instances`. O channel-gateway lê o token nos metadados da sessão outbound e publica `collect.responded` ao fechar a sessão → workflow-api resume o workflow com `decision: "input"`.

#### Campaign = N instâncias com mesmo campaign_id

Não há entidade "campaign" separada. Um `campaign_id` é um agrupador livre em `workflow.instances` e `collect_instances`. A CampaignPanel do Operator Console agrega via `collect_events` no ClickHouse.

#### Kafka topics

| Topic | Producer | Consumer(s) |
|---|---|---|
| `collect.events` | workflow-api (collect endpoints + timeout scanner) | analytics-api → ClickHouse collect_events |

### ContextStore integration — origin_session_id

Workflows lançados a partir de uma sessão ativa de cliente (via `task` step `mode: transfer`,
escalação, ou coleta outbound) devem ler e escrever no ContextStore da sessão originadora —
não no hash do workflow UUID.

**Regra:** `{tenant}:ctx:{origin_session_id}` é o ContextStore key correto para @ctx.* em workflows.

**Campo `origin_session_id`** adicionado a:
- `WorkflowInstanceSchema` (`@plughub/schemas/workflow.ts`) — campo nullable, documenta a sessão originadora
- `workflow.instances` (PostgreSQL) — coluna `origin_session_id TEXT` com migration idempotente
- `TriggerRequest` (workflow-api `router.py`) — campo opcional no body do trigger
- `WorkflowInstance` interface (`skill-flow-worker/workflow-client.ts`) — campo opcional

**Resolução no EngineRunner** (`skill-flow-worker/engine-runner.ts`):
```typescript
// origin_session_id presente → usa ContextStore da sessão real do cliente
// origin_session_id ausente  → usa instance.id (headless/standalone workflow)
const contextSessionId = instance.origin_session_id ?? instance.id

await engine.run({
  tenantId:  instance.tenant_id,
  sessionId: contextSessionId,   // ← chave do ContextStore ({tenant}:ctx:{contextSessionId})
  instanceId: instance.id,       // ← UUID do workflow para pipeline_state e lifecycle
  ...
})
```

**Como usar no trigger:**
```json
POST /v1/workflow/trigger
{
  "tenant_id":         "tenant_demo",
  "flow_id":           "fluxo_cobranca_v1",
  "trigger_type":      "event",
  "session_id":        "sess_abc123",
  "origin_session_id": "sess_abc123",
  "context": { "invoice_id": "INV-001", "amount": 15000 }
}
```

Quando o workflow executa steps `reason` com `context_tags.inputs`, os campos
`@ctx.caller.nome`, `@ctx.caller.cpf` etc. são lidos do ContextStore da sessão `sess_abc123` —
onde foram acumulados pelo `agente_contexto_ia_v1` durante o atendimento.

**Workflows standalone** (sem sessão originadora — triggers de schedule, webhook externo):
`origin_session_id = null` → engine usa `{tenant}:ctx:{instance.id}` — hash isolado por workflow.

## Agent Assist UI — `packages/platform-ui/src/modules/agent-assist/` (task #172)

**Migrated from `packages/agent-assist-ui/` to platform-ui shell.** Route: `/agent-assist` (roles: operator, supervisor, admin). agentName from `useAuth()` session.name; poolId from `?pool=` URL param with inline picker when absent. Uses `h-full` instead of `h-screen` (Shell provides the outer container).

Vite proxies added: `'^/api'` → `http://localhost:3100`, `'^/agent-ws'` → `ws://localhost:3100` (ws: true).

New dependency: `recharts@^2.x` (used by EstadoTab sentiment line chart).

**Module structure:**
```
modules/agent-assist/
  AgentAssistPage.tsx          ← main page (adapts App.tsx)
  types.ts                     ← all type definitions
  hooks/
    useAgentWebSocket.ts       ← persistent WS, reconnect, heartbeat
    useSupervisorState.ts      ← polls /api/supervisor_state/{sessionId}
    useSupervisorCapabilities.ts
    useCustomerHistory.ts      ← GET /analytics/sessions/customer/{id}
  components/
    Header.tsx                 ← handle-time, SLA bar, WS dot
    ChatArea.tsx               ← messages + live sentiment strip
    AgentInput.tsx             ← textarea + Encerrar button
    CloseModal.tsx             ← issue_status + outcome + handoff_reason
    MessageBubble.tsx          ← per-author styles + MenuCard delegation
    MenuCard.tsx               ← read-only menu interaction preview
    ContactList.tsx            ← per-contact cards with sentiment/SLA/timer
    RightPanel.tsx             ← 4-tab container
    ToastContainer.tsx         ← fixed bottom-right notifications
    tabs/
      EstadoTab.tsx            ← sentiment chart (recharts), intent, flags, SLA
      CapacidadesTab.tsx       ← suggested agents + escalation options
      ContextoTab.tsx          ← ContextSnapshotCard (teal) + ContactContextCard (emerald)
      HistoricoTab.tsx         ← customer session history
```

**Legacy app** (`packages/agent-assist-ui/`, port 5175) — frozen, kept as reference.

React 18 + TypeScript + Vite. **Original** porta de dev: 5175. Proxy: `/api` → mcp-server-plughub (3100), `/agent-ws` → WS mcp-server (3100), `/analytics` → analytics-api (3500).

### Layout

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Header (agente, pool, sessão, SLA, WS) │
├────────────────────┬────────────────────┤
│  ChatArea (60%)    │  RightPanel (40%)  │
├────────────────────┴────────────────────┤
│  AgentInput + CloseModal trigger        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Fluxo de sessão

1. UI abre em modo lobby (`wsSessionId=null`, conecta via `pool` no WS)
2. `conversation.assigned` chega via `pool:events:{poolId}` → `setSessionId`, `fetchHistory`, atualiza URL
3. Mensagens chegam por `message.text` WS events → adicionadas a `messages[]`
4. Agente encerra → `handleClose` → POST `/api/agent_done/{sessionId}` → volta ao lobby
5. Cliente desconecta → `session.closed` com `client_disconnect` → modal de encerramento pendente

### Componentes

| Componente | Responsabilidade |
|---|---|
| `Header` | Nome do agente, pool, session_id, status WS, SLA badge, timer de atendimento ao vivo |
| `ChatArea` | Lista de mensagens + indicador de digitação AI + painel de sentimento ao vivo |
| `AgentInput` | Input de texto, botão enviar, trigger do CloseModal |
| `CloseModal` | issue_status, outcome, handoff_reason antes de chamar agent_done |
| `RightPanel` | Tab container: Estado / Capacidades / Contexto / Histórico |
| `ToastContainer` | Notificações temporárias e persistentes |

### RightPanel — tabs

| Tab | Conteúdo |
|---|---|
| `estado` | `EstadoTab` — sentimento (score, trend, alert), intent, SLA, flags |
| `capacidades` | `CapacidadesTab` — suggested_agents + escalation suggestions |
| `contexto` | `ContextoTab` — historical_insights (azul) + conversation_insights (roxo) |
| `historico` | `HistoricoTab` — últimos 20 contatos fechados do cliente via analytics-api |

### HistoricoTab — implementação

- Hook `useCustomerHistory(customerId)` — fetch `GET /analytics/sessions/customer/{id}?tenant_id=VITE_TENANT_ID&limit=20`
- Env vars: `VITE_ANALYTICS_URL` (default `/analytics`), `VITE_TENANT_ID` (default `tenant_demo`)
- Re-busca automaticamente quando `customerId` muda
- Cancela fetch anterior em cada re-render (cleanup via flag `cancelled`)
- `HistoryRow` — expansível: summary (ícone de canal, badge de outcome, data, duração, close_reason) + detalhes (pool, canal, session_id)
- Estado vazio quando `customerId === null` ("Cliente não identificado")
- Graceful degradation: erro retorna `[]` com mensagem de erro não-bloqueante

### Auto-reconexão WebSocket

`useAgentWebSocket` — reconnect automático com delay de 3s em close inesperado:
- `reconnectCount` state: incrementado por `ws.onclose` quando `!intentionalClose.current`
- `intentionalClose` ref: setado no cleanup do useEffect (unmount ou mudança de dep)
- Dependency array: `[sessionId ?? poolId, reconnectCount]` — reconecta ao bump de `reconnectCount`
- Na reconexão, mcp-server entrega `pool:pending_assignment:{poolId}` (TTL 300s) para retomar sessão em andamento

### Handle-time counter

`Header.tsx` recebe `sessionStartedAt: Date | null` — prop passado de App.tsx quando `conversation.assigned` chega. `useEffect`/`setInterval` a cada 1s atualiza `handleMs = Date.now() - sessionStartedAt`. Formato: `M:SS` (< 1h) ou `H:MM:SS` (≥ 1h). Vira laranja após 30 minutos para alertar o agente. Resetado para `null` ao encerrar sessão em ambos os fluxos.

### Renderização de mensagens `agents_only`

**Backend fix** — `message_send` em `mcp-server/tools/session.ts` agora publica no canal Redis `agent:events:{session_id}` depois do XADD. Publicação ocorre para `visibility: "all"` e `"agents_only"` (não para arrays de participant_ids). O `author.type` no envelope WS é determinado consultando `{tenant_id}:agent:instance:{participant_id}` — se tiver `agent_type_id`, emite `"agent_ai"`, caso contrário `"agent_human"`. Entrega WS é best-effort (try/catch não-fatal).

**Gap corrigido** — o bridge de orquestração só encaminhava `conversations.inbound` (mensagens do cliente). Com essa mudança, mensagens de agentes IA com `visibility: "all"` e notas internas com `visibility: "agents_only"` chegam ao agente humano em tempo real.

**Frontend** — `ChatMessage.visibility?: string` e `WsMessageText.visibility?: string` adicionados em `types.ts`. `App.tsx` propaga `event.visibility` ao construir o `ChatMessage`. `MessageBubble.tsx` detecta `visibility === "agents_only"` e renderiza:
- Background âmbar (`bg-amber-50`) com borda tracejada âmbar (`border-dashed border-amber-400`)
- Badge "Interno" em âmbar antes do label do autor
- Posicionado à esquerda (nunca à direita, independente do autor)

### Menu de aprovação — renderização no chat (modo observação)

`ChatMenuData` interface adicionada em `types.ts` com campos `menu_id`, `interaction`, `prompt`, `options?`, `fields?`. `ChatMessage.menuData?: ChatMenuData` adicionado — quando presente, `MessageBubble.tsx` delega para `MenuCard` em vez de renderizar um bubble normal.

**`components/MenuCard.tsx`** (novo) — card read-only com badge de tipo de interação + label "IA → Cliente · observação". Renderizadores por tipo:

| Tipo | Renderização |
|---|---|
| `text` | Prompt + indicador "Aguardando resposta em texto livre…" |
| `button` | Chips com borda indigo arredondada, `disabled` |
| `list` | Lista numerada com itens separados por linha, `disabled` |
| `checklist` | Checkboxes com labels, todos `disabled` |
| `form` | Campos `<input>` com label acima, `disabled` |

**`App.tsx`** — evento `menu.render` agora popula `menuData` estruturado no lugar do texto plano com bullets. O campo `text` mantém o `prompt` como fallback para consumidores simples.

**Modo substituição (futuro)** — todos os elementos interativos têm apenas `disabled`; ativar substitution mode requer remover o atributo + adicionar handler `POST /api/menu_submit/{sessionId}`.

Scenario 06 covers two parts:
- **Part A** — Conference happy path: primary agent busy → supervisor calls `agent_join_conference` → Redis `conference:*` keys verified → specialist `agent_done` with `conference_id` (session stays open) → primary `agent_done` closes session
- **Part B** — Reconnect resilience: agent busy → MCP transport torn down → new transport reconnected → re-login with same `instance_id` → Redis state (agent instance + active sessions) persists → `agent_done` with new session_token concludes session cleanly
